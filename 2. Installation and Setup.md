These are the things we will cover this section and how important they each are. 

So, the first thing we cover are the two main ways of using Git from the command line and from graphical user interfaces.

# Installing Git: Terminal Vs. GUIs

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212689022-48f12b1e-c8a0-4d6e-9f20-4fea9ab3b593.png)

So before we go on to installation, we need to start by talking about the two options for how we interact with Git.

1. We can use the terminal, a text based interface
2. And we can use graphical user interfaces.

Git was originally created as a primarily terminal terminal based interface and still is to this day.

As Git's popularity has increased, so have a number of GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces). These are pieces of software you can download that make it  more visual and graphical to interact with Git.

For example, if we wanted to see a history of all the different people who have collaborated or all the different checkpoints, here they all are ...

This is what it looks like on the terminal.

However, on a GUI, it will look like ...

GUI is easier to use but terminal is quicker. As a developer, you will be expected to know how to use the terminal.

# Pros and Cons to the GUI

# Pros and Cons to the Command Line

There are some features that you can really only do or interact with on the command line.

# Windows Git Installation

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212774306-432cacf9-251b-481f-b432-35ac5384f408.png)

Installing Git on a Windows machine is it's not complicated, but it's a little bit trickier than to do it on a MAC. This is because Git was created to run on a Unix based interface.

It was designed for Linux because the guy who created Git, Linus Torvalds, also created Linux.

Issue with Windows based system is is that Windows machines don't come with a Unix based prompt by default. Windows comes with a different command line interface called Command Prompt. It's not Unix based.

Git wants to run with a Unix based interface and there's this shell called Bash which is a default shell for Linux machines and for Macs. So, installing Git on those machines is much easier.

To install Git on a Windows machine, we have to download something called Git Bash, which we're about to do. And Git Bash is going to emulate a bash, a Unix experience on our Windows Machine and it comes with Git also.

The first thing we need to do is go to the Git Home page, the Git website, and download the Git installer for Windows.

Click on `Download for Windows` ...

Click on `Click here to download`. And once downloaded, open the file and run it.

Then it will ask where I want to install it. I'll leave it as the default.

Will leave these as default and click on `Next`.

Will call the shortcut it creates for us `Git` too.

Currently, when choosing the default editor used by Git, it is set to Vim. Instead we will choose `Use Visual Studio Code as Git's default editor` from the drop down menu ...

Like so.
