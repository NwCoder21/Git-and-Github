# Installation and Setup

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212688527-67196e63-61a3-48e3-a947-f2cccfeb8905.png)

These are the things we will cover this section and how important they each are. 

So, the first thing we cover are the two main ways of using Git from the command line and from graphical user interfaces.

# Installing Git: Terminal Vs. GUIs

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212689022-48f12b1e-c8a0-4d6e-9f20-4fea9ab3b593.png)

So before we go on to installation, we need to start by talking about the two options for how we interact with Git.

1. We can use the terminal, a text based interface
2. And we can use graphical user interfaces.

Git was originally created as a primarily terminal terminal based interface and still is to this day.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212690447-e27d7c4a-7999-4b47-b141-6ff891c983a9.png)

As Git's popularity has increased, so have a number of GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces). These are pieces of software you can download that make it  more visual and graphical to interact with Git.

For example, if we wanted to see a history of all the different people who have collaborated or all the different checkpoints, here they all are ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212692112-d217a763-0aec-4589-8d72-17463f53fd97.png)

This is what it looks like on the terminal.

However, on a GUI, it will look like ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212692274-041cc055-2644-4b85-b51d-40ffdf916600.png)

GUI is easier to use but terminal is quicker. As a developer, you will be expected to know how to use the terminal.

# Pros and Cons to the GUI

# Pros and Cons to the Command Line 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212693027-94855ce3-c617-4e1f-9e2f-83d74171a632.png)

There are some features that you can really only do or interact with on the command line.

# Windows Git Installation

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212774306-432cacf9-251b-481f-b432-35ac5384f408.png)

Installing Git on a Windows machine is it's not complicated, but it's a little bit trickier than to do it on a MAC. This is because Git was created to run on a Unix based interface.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212774435-2799183f-e450-42dc-960a-9cc5fe13c51a.png)

It was designed for Linux because the guy who created Git, Linus Torvalds, also created Linux.

Issue with Windows based system is is that Windows machines don't come with a Unix based prompt by default. Windows comes with a different command line interface called Command Prompt. It's not Unix based.

Git wants to run with a Unix based interface and there's this shell called Bash which is a default shell for Linux machines and for Macs. So, installing Git on those machines is much easier.

To install Git on a Windows machine, we have to download something called Git Bash, which we're about to do. And Git Bash is going to emulate a bash, a Unix experience on our Windows Machine and it comes with Git also.

---

The first thing we need to do is go to the Git Home page, the Git website, and download the Git installer for Windows.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212777053-805d2a16-3614-400e-bdd2-b4e6ee69c470.png)

Click on `Download for Windows` ...

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212777153-41b2c955-9192-4b4c-8e4a-ba981e97b58b.png)


Click on `Click here to download`. And once downloaded, open the file and run it.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212777281-85eece1f-d762-4a32-adf7-c160afad8e84.png)

Then it will ask where I want to install it. I'll leave it as the default.

---

Will leave these as default and click on `Next`.

Will call the shortcut it creates for us `Git` too.

---

Currently, when choosing the default editor used by Git, it is set to Vim. Instead we will choose `Use Visual Studio Code as Git's default editor` from the drop down menu ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212778405-fe49745f-617b-4287-84dc-0a9b5d02f939.png)

Like so.

Once that option has been selected, it won'tlet us click on `Next` as we don't have Visual Studio Code installed on the machne yet. Click on the link to download it ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212778668-6908d75a-a771-4bd6-919c-43fab222659f.png)

Agree to the agreement if you wish to do so.

 Will check both of these options.

Don't need to launch it. All we needed it for was so we can continue with the Git installation.

---

Go back to the Git installation process. 

---

It still won'tregister that Visual Studio Code has been installed. Click on `Back` and then click on `Next` to come back to this page.

Can now click on the `Next` button.

Here, will let Git decide. 

Side note: there's been a push to rename the default branch in Git and GitHub from `master` to `Main` or some other similar name like `Trunk` or `development`. Later, will cover how to change the default branch name. We'll talk about how to work with `Main` instead of `master` and we'll cover all of this.

The terminal will then open. 

Type:

```yaml
git --version
```

This means a Git command is being recognised so we are good to go.

---

If you close the terminal and wish to open it again, search for Git bash ...

# Git on Linux 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212782495-1a2603cd-59e4-4d54-b24f-46d32bf80fec.png)

Git comes with Linux.

# Configuring Your Git Name & Email

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212782544-a1e9423f-5393-4b6c-abc0-a7a5b46a52cc.png)

Now, we need to tell Git our name and email. Do NOT need to register for an account though to do this.

---

Setting up a name is important as it allows to see when you have made changes and others can then see what changes you have made.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212783028-d41cf1c6-f2e1-442b-8ccd-cddc889cc2a8.png)

For example, here we can see that a Dan Abramov made a change. he idea is that Git knows who did what work and who is making these checkpoints and these changes. So we need to configure that.

So this does not have to match some account that you have somewhere else. However, I recommend that you use the name that you want to be known by as a developer. If you are going to publish your work and put it up on GitHub, you want to use a name that people know you buy or that will be consistent.

You don't want to be changing this all the time. 

And then your email. I recommend configuring with the email that you'll set up for your GitHub account if you haven't done so, we'll do it later in the course when we talk about GitHub, we can cross that bridge.

---

We can always reconfigure these two values (name and email.

---

# Setting Our Name 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212783298-94529a95-3751-4cbe-a63c-1b3a482c1383.png)

Use:

```yaml
git config --global user.name "<your_name>"
```

---

To check what username Git has already for us, we can use:

```yaml
git config user.name 
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212785120-45d7bc2b-4ef2-41db-a8e9-000d3a4890d8.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212900200-5d66d936-b674-46a4-ac99-f51b89421b44.png)


Here, it does not have one already so let's configure one.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212900784-76b92226-a096-4f5a-acdd-453c73f246d4.png)


Used:

```yaml
git config --global user.name "Nw Coder21"
```

to set my name as `Nw Coder21`. When we then press `Enter`, nothing really happens. So run: 

```yaml
git config user.name
```

to confirm that changes have been made. We can now see that the name has been updated.

---
 
# Setting Our Email 

First, let's check if there is an email attached to this user. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213420735-a3abdc3a-447b-4830-9302-94165605dfa1.png)

Using:

```yaml
git config user.email
```

we can see that currently, there is no email with this user.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213421712-6fe86379-4fda-4957-aac8-125e41139359.png)

To set an email, use:

```yaml
git config --global user.email <email_address>
```

Then use:

```yaml
git config user.email
```

to check that it has been updated.

---

When setting up email, try to use the one which you think you will be using for GitHub. 

To change the email, use the same command 

```yaml
git config --global user.email <email_address>
```

If you have a GitHub account already, you can use those details to sign up. In this case i'll be signing up as a brand new user.
