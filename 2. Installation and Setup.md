These are the things we will cover this section and how important they each are. 

So, the first thing we cover are the two main ways of using Git from the command line and from graphical user interfaces.

# Installing Git: Terminal Vs. GUIs

So before we go on to installation, we need to start by talking about the two options for how we interact with Git.

1. We can use the terminal, a text based interface
2. And we can use graphical user interfaces.

Git was originally created as a primarily terminal terminal based interface and still is to this day.

As Git's popularity has increased, so have a number of GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces). These are pieces of software you can download that make it  more visual and graphical to interact with Git.

For example, if we wanted to see a history of all the different people who have collaborated or all the different checkpoints, here they all are ...

GUI is easier to use but terminal is quicker. As a developer, you will be expected to know how to use the terminal.

There are some features that you can really only do or interact with on the command line.
