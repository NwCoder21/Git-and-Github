# Project: Poem Fiasco

In this project, changes have been made to a series of poems and you want to change them back.

road-not-taken.txt:
```
I Took All the Roads, by Robert Forks

Two roads went exactly the same way
And I was happy to travel them both
And be one traveler, I figured it out quick
blah blah blah
blah blah blah blah

blah blah blah blah
Both had terrible claims
Because it was smooth and boring
blah blah blah blah
This poem is terrible, Rob.

blah blah blah blah
In leaves no step had trodden blah
Oh, blah blah blah BLAAAAHHH
WEEEEEEEE!! This road is awesome.
I'm definitely coming back here!

Hahahahahahahhaha
Two roads diverged in a hahahahaha
HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAH! Gotcha.

oven-bird.txt:

```
The Annoying Bird, by Robyn Lost

There is a terrible singer nobody wants to hear,
Loud, a mid-summer waker-upper bird,
Who makes aweful noise all day and night,
Like BAAAAAAAAH! And QUACK!
He says things that make no sense
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH BAAAAAH QUACK
On sunny days a moment's CHIRP;
Ruining your poem ruining your poem ruining it, yeah!
This one will never ever ever ever be published, nope!
The bird would CHIRP CHIRP BAAAK!
bird bird bird bird bird bird
```


fire-and-ice.txt:

```
Fire and Ice, by Robert Frost

Some say the world will end in fire,
Some say in ice.
From what I've tasted of desire
I hold with those who favor fire.
But if it had to perish twice,
I think I know enough of hate
To say that for destruction ice

Step 1: The file road-not-taken.txt doesn’t look right at all! Perhaps a rival poet snuck in and changed it while you were getting coffee. Good thing you’ve been committing often.

* Checkout the HEAD version of road-not-taken.txt to discard changes made to the working directory.
*  Close and re-open the file to see the result.

Step 2: Now, finish the poem by adding a line. Here’s a suggestion:

```
And that has made all the difference.
```

Then click Save.

Step 3: Take a look at **oven-bird.txt** to see if it has also been tampered with.

Indeed it has! We’ll want to discard changes in the working directory again.

There’s a commonly used shortcut for this command:

```
git checkout -- filename 
```

It does the same exact thing that `git checkout HEAD filename` does. Try it with **oven-bird.txt**.

Step 4: , finish “Oven Bird” by adding a line. Here’s a suggestion:

```
Is what to make of a diminished thing.
```

Then click Save.

Step 5: Click on **fire-and-ice.txt**.

This file has not been altered, but just to be sure, check the diff for this file.

Then, add these last two lines to the poem: 

```
Is also okay
And would suffice.
```

Step 6: Now that you’ve restored and completed **road-not-taken.txt **and **oven-bird.txt** and added a line to **fire-and-ice.txt**, add all three of the files to the staging area with a single command.

Step 7: **fire-and-ice.txt** could be better. Before you commit, remove this file from the staging area.

Step 8: Now that you’ve removed **fire-and-ice.txt**, make a commit.

Step 9: You get the crazy idea to change your poems in a big way.

Make some drastic changes to each of the three poems. Remember to click Save after each file change.

Step 10: Now add all three files to the staging area.

Step 11: Make a commit.

Step 12: A little later you take a look at the current state of your poems and regret your last commit.

Reset your Git project to the commit before you made those drastic changes.

Step 13: There’s a problem: you reset `HEAD` to a previous commit, but the changes you want to get rid of are still in the working directory.

What Git backtracking command that you already know can discard changes to the working directory, restoring the files to the way they look in the `HEAD` commit?
