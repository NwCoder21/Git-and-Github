# 6. Working with Branches

In this section, we will covering one of the most useful features in git, branching. Branching will come up on a daily basis, just like committing if you work with Git on a daily basis.

This is what we will be covering in this section.

# Introducing Branches

First, let's quickly look at how Git works at a very basic level. 

When we make a commit, each commit gets a number like this ...

this long series of numbers and letters that is supposed to be unique that corresponds to the contents of a commit.

All that we need to know is that every commit has this unique hash (unique identifier) that corresponds to the commits, and each commit references at least one parent commit that came before it.

In the above example, we have a linear history of commits where one commit leads to the next, which leads to the next ntil we get to a point where there is no commit before the first commit.

However, when we're working on a real project in the real world, we need to work in multiple contexts simultaneously. For example, I work at some company abd :

* I'm working on a web application and I'm trying out two different color scheme variations for a website. And I want to try them both out and figure out which one I like best. 
* Also, at the same time, I have been tasked with trying to fix a really horrible bug.
* And at the same time, one of my teammates is working on adding a new feature, a chat bot.
* And then another coworker is adding some new functionality to the search bar autocomplete
* another developer is doing a very experimental radical design overhaul of our entire application layout.

This is the context.

If we all worked in a linear fashion, one commit after the next, this would be practically impossible. How could we be working on separate things, some of which break other people's code? For example, If I'm trying to fix a bad bug and deleting a bunch of code, removing files, that will cause big problems if somebody else is trying to add a new feature.

Likewise, if someone is doing a radical experimental design change on every single view of our application and at the same time, I'm trying to work on some minor color scheme variations, or if someone's working on adding a chat widget to the bottom right of our screen.

Those things need to happen in separate contexts because they have implications on one another and they really need to happen in isolation until maybe at some point we decide to incorporate changes into each other's contexts.

This is where branching comes in. That's exactly what Git branches allow us to do.

Branches allow us to create separate contexts whenever we want. We can experiment, we can break stuff, and whatever we do on one branch will not impact what happens on other branches, although we can decide to then combine branches, we call that merging and we'll learn how to do that. But that's something we have to decide to do.

Otherwise, if we make a change in one branch, the other branches do not know about it. They exist in isolation.

This allows me to make a commit and maybe make another commit on one branch and then at any point splinter off and try something on this pink branch up top. I'm calling New Color Scheme. When I branch off and add more commits, the new commits are not addedd to the main branch until I merge back.

So I could branch off again and work on a bug fix. But again, totally separate context.

And then I could branch off even further from this bug fix branch and branch further to do an experimental redesign.

So now I have at least four different contexts

And we can even have someone still working on the Main branch (middle one).

We're all working in separate contexts, but then a very important part is being able to then combine and merge branches together when appropriate. If you work on a bug fix and you actually solve it, then you want to merge that bug fix into the main code base.
