# 6. Working with Branches

In this section, we will covering one of the most useful features in git, branching. Branching will come up on a daily basis, just like committing if you work with Git on a daily basis.

# Introducing Branches

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215620602-85038bcf-46b2-479f-a92c-7095f19941a5.png)

First, let's quickly look at how Git works at a very basic level. 

When we make a commit, each commit gets a number like this ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215621099-da50a031-9d5b-4c43-aeeb-ecccac0e82b7.png)

this long series of numbers and letters that is supposed to be unique that corresponds to the contents of a commit.

All that we need to know is that every commit has this unique hash (unique identifier) that corresponds to the commits, and each commit references at least one parent commit that came before it.

In the above example, we have a linear history of commits where one commit leads to the next, which leads to the next until we get to a point where there is no commit before the first commit.

However, when we're working on a real project in the real world, we need to work in multiple contexts simultaneously. For example, I work at some company abd :

* I'm working on a web application and I'm trying out two different color scheme variations for a website. And I want to try them both out and figure out which one I like best. 
* Also, at the same time, I have been tasked with trying to fix a really horrible bug.
* And at the same time, one of my teammates is working on adding a new feature, a chat bot.
* And then another coworker is adding some new functionality to the search bar autocomplete
* another developer is doing a very experimental radical design overhaul of our entire application layout.

This is the context.

---

If we all worked in a linear fashion, one commit after the next, this would be practically impossible. How could we be working on separate things, some of which break other people's code? For example, If I'm trying to fix a bad bug and deleting a bunch of code, removing files, that will cause big problems if somebody else is trying to add a new feature.

Likewise, if someone is doing a radical experimental design change on every single view of our application and at the same time, I'm trying to work on some minor color scheme variations, or if someone's working on adding a chat widget to the bottom right of our screen.

Those things need to happen in separate contexts because they have implications on one another and they really need to happen in isolation until maybe at some point we decide to incorporate changes into each other's contexts.

---

This is where branching comes in. That's exactly what Git branches allow us to do.

Branches allow us to create separate contexts whenever we want. We can experiment, we can break stuff, and whatever we do on one branch will not impact what happens on other branches, although we can decide to then combine branches, we call that merging and we'll learn how to do that. But that's something we have to decide to do.

Otherwise, if we make a change in one branch, the other branches do not know about it. They exist in isolation.

This allows me to make a commit and maybe make another commit on one branch and then at any point splinter off and try something on this pink branch up top. I'm calling New Color Scheme. When I branch off and add more commits, the new commits are not added to the main branch until I merge back. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215625250-8b5f6547-e9e2-4d84-a8c7-4a2d003c7674.png)

So I could branch off again and work on a bug fix. But again, totally separate context.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215625410-06518421-37aa-4f04-83a9-d8cb737457f3.png)

And then I could branch off even further from this bug fix branch and branch further to do an experimental redesign.

So now I have at least four different contexts

---

And we can even have someone still working on the Main branch (middle one).

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215625696-aa81e5fd-c9ca-4271-af1d-7e5da675052f.png)

We're all working in separate contexts, but then a very important part is being able to then combine and merge branches together when appropriate. If you work on a bug fix and you actually solve it, then you want to merge that bug fix into the main code base.

 # The Master Branch (Or Is It Main?)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215626736-b9333027-7813-4c16-b57e-00ed190cd8a4.png)

In Git you are always working on a branch and we've seen evidence of this. `On Branch Master, nothing to commit`. For example:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215627040-5c0ca2ac-beca-44bd-95e4-abcc3f100fe6.png)

And it shows you which branch you are on too, in this case, the master branch. So when we learn how to change branches, you'll see that updated as well on this right hand side.

So we're always on a branch. Even though we didn't decide to be on the master branch, that's where we are by default.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215627198-3e07c312-9024-437f-9ddb-bab39d73b74b.png)

Master branch is just the default branch name. When we make a new git repository, in other words, when we run `git init`, automatically the branch that we start on is called Master.

There's nothing special about Master except for the fact that it just happens to be made for you.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215627401-e2b4ebd8-1e10-4e0d-ac59-8e16a73c8afd.png)

Some people treat it as their official project branch, i.e., the main branch where they don't want to mess anything up. And then they'll try things on other branches and if they work, they combine them back into the master branch.

> Remember: the master branch does not have to hold the master copy of your project. You can delete it and also rename it.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215627804-273b2e84-f65d-49e7-9414-58a8380980e8.png)

The name on Git and GitHub for the default branch name for a long time was Master. However, in 2020, GitHub announced that they were renaming the default branch name from Master to Main as part of a larger push by tech companies to try and avoid any potentially offensive language.

It was just GitHub that made this change from Master to Main. with Git. However, on Git, the default branch name is still Master. That's why we see `on branch master`. 


We can change the default branch name. If you want to do this, it's easy to do, but we'll cover it we know more about branches.

As mentioned above, a lot of people treat it as their main branch, a place where things should always be working and it be a place for the main copy of their code base or of their project. Then they can make a branch to try something experimental and make some commits and test something out. And then if they like that, they can incorporate it back to the Master Branch or they can abandon it and just move on and keep working on their master branch and just not incorporate this experimental branch.

This is an approach a lot of people use. It's a very common workflow and we will have a section on git workflows and collaboration patterns later on. The above one is called feature branching or creating feature branches where ou have your main or your master branch which acts as the source of truth, and then you add new feature branches and merge them back in when it makes sense.

# What On Earth Is HEAD?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215632080-528dab24-accb-4b21-ab09-16b42d308b3c.png)

There's one more concept we need to get out of the way before we can talk about creating branches, which is this thing right here, `Head`. 

This appears when we run the `git log` command, such as ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215632661-9763e8ac-25c5-4adf-bc17-d66dd11c1e33.png)

So what is thing long line of numbers and letters? 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215632965-2bf2fe1a-9d06-461b-b22c-feb20e053153.png)

`HEAD` is just a term in Git. Specifically, it is a pointer that refers to our current location in the repository and it points to a particular branch reference.

Another way to explain it is think of branches as bookmarks in a book. We can have a whole bunch of different bookmarks, different places in a book. At any given point in time, only one of those bookmarks/spots can be open.

So only one is active. Only one is being read or being viewed.

So that is what `HEAD` refers to.

`HEAD` is our current location that we are viewing or that we are checking out is a common term you'll hear.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215633820-e9fb2bf9-a5a9-4573-bcf9-b344056cbd21.png)


So in our case, we haven't done anything with `HEAD`, we haven't made any branches.

So `HEAD` always is referring to our master branch, the last commit on our master branch. So `HEAD` refers to the branch pointer.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215634126-330afbf1-709a-4c26-8941-c4e146a4405d.png)

Then if I had more branches and I switched to, for example, a different branch like I switched to Ethel's branch, `HEAD` points to the tip of Ethel Branch.

---

I want to reiterate, `HEAD` is a pointer. It's a reference to a branch pointer and a branch pointer is where a branch currently is.

**Each branch has a branch reference pointing to where we left off. That's really the key takeaway here**

# Viewing All Branches With Git Branch

`git branch`: This will just give us a list of our current existing branches in a repo so it doesn't make a new branch, it doesn't switch branches, it just shows you the current branches.

In our case, we haven't made new branches, so we won't see anything except Master ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215635943-b6493630-b357-41eb-af81-43d915aa5d01.png)

To get out of it, press `q`.

If you have multiple branches, you will see them outputted but the one that is active has a little asterisk next to it. That's the branch we're currently on.

Next up, we're going to learn how to make a new branch.

So next we're going to learn how to make our own branches and how to switch between them.
