This is the Reference page. There are lots of options for every single one of the git commands.

So, if you ever come across an option being used with a git command, you can see here what it means.

# Keeping Your Commits Atomic

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215350807-72cab1e5-ec3e-4b5f-ac16-74687687a8d8.png)

What this means is, try and keep each commit focused on a single thing. It's super important to keep things as atomic as possible, to keep each commit focused on one thing. This does not mean one file, rather it means one feature, one thing that you worked on.

This matters a lot when you're working on code, especially when you're working with a team of people,

# Commit Messages: Present Or Past Tense?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215351788-12f16801-f390-4944-a3cf-c8b4e0dfcbec.png)

The git documentation officially recommends that you use present tense imperative style commit messages.

So present tense meaning verbs like "make something or "change x", "fix x" instead of past tense "fixed", "changed", or "updated". Example of imperative can be seen from the above slide. 

Can use past tense but convention is present or imperative. Keep in mind what others at your organisation are used to adapting and follow that. 

Below are some articles on this matter:

# Escaping VIM & Configuring Git's Default Editor

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215353017-34676319-3d53-411b-a312-197b1277cfc8.png)

To commit a change, if we only use `git commit`, it will open up the vim editor ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215353043-0695ee3e-5c71-4a31-80a1-0bd95cbdab19.png)

It is asking you for a commit message. to add it, press `i` and enter your message. Here, I have written `Updated Welcome.txt`.

Then exit by pressing the `escape` key, `:`, `x!`.

Then our commit message is added.

Sometimes, using the `-m` option with `git commit` might not be the best as we might want to add a lot more text as the message, for example, multiple lines. 


So, what we want to do is configure the `git commit` so that when it is run without the `-m` message, it will open up an editor of our choice.

To set the editor to Visual Studio COde, use `git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`

We are using `--global` so that this change applies to every repo, not just the current repo.

When we run it, we won't see any change but now let's make another change.

I've made some changes to the Welcome.txt file and have added them too. So, now it is ready to be commited.

Now when I run `git commit`, Visual Studio Code is opened up instead of vim.

This is my multi-line commit message and then close the file and go back to git bash ...

I can now see that the commit has been made ...
