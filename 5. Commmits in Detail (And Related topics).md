# Keeping Your Commits Atomic

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215350807-72cab1e5-ec3e-4b5f-ac16-74687687a8d8.png)

What this means is, try and keep each commit focused on a single thing. It's super important to keep things as atomic as possible, to keep each commit focused on one thing. This does not mean one file, rather it means one feature, one thing that you worked on.

This matters a lot when you're working on code, especially when you're working with a team of people,

# Commit Messages: Present Or Past Tense?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215351788-12f16801-f390-4944-a3cf-c8b4e0dfcbec.png)

The git documentation officially recommends that you use present tense imperative style commit messages.

So present tense meaning verbs like "make something or "change x", "fix x" instead of past tense "fixed", "changed", or "updated". Example of imperative can be seen from the above slide. 

Can use past tense but convention is present or imperative. Keep in mind what others at your organisation are used to adapting and follow that. 

Below are some articles on this matter:

# Escaping VIM & Configuring Git's Default Editor

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215353017-34676319-3d53-411b-a312-197b1277cfc8.png)

To commit a change, if we only use `git commit`, it will open up the vim editor ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215353043-0695ee3e-5c71-4a31-80a1-0bd95cbdab19.png)

It is asking you for a commit message. to add it, press `i` and enter your message. Here, I have written `Updated Welcome.txt`.

Then exit by pressing the `escape` key, `:`, `x!`.  

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215353210-8e262d43-a467-451b-a409-b33a972bae39.png)

Then our commit message is added.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215353271-e05ef76e-fe54-48bb-8353-f1ed258b0444.png)

Sometimes, using the `-m` option with `git commit` might not be the best as we might want to add a lot more text as the message, for example, multiple lines. 


So, what we want to do is configure the `git commit` so that when it is run without the `-m` message, it will open up an editor of our choice.

To set the editor to Visual Studio COde, use `git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`

We are using `--global` so that this change applies to every repo, not just the current repo.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215353606-1c770594-9a27-4814-ae79-0956fbcd0390.png)

When we run it, we won't see any change but now let's make another change. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215353653-8afaa854-53c4-4ded-8e98-7d77549eae8f.png)

I've made some changes to the Welcome.txt file and have added them too. So, now it is ready to be commited. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215353754-d6c1ab56-244b-409f-9941-d76966fe1a79.png)

Now when I run `git commit`, Visual Studio Code is opened up instead of vim.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215353882-e33e3973-17b1-4cad-8a34-30e2797fa061.png)

This is my multi-line commit message and then close the file and go back to git bash ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215353930-c217fa15-bc88-4e9a-9f01-fcff702ce9ae.png)

I can now see that the commit has been made ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215353957-1f77c20b-e1b8-450a-9504-a8cacdad58b1.png)

> Remember: Once you start working on larger projects, it's definitely important to be able to open up and write messages in an editor. You can do that by using `git commit`.

# Closer Look at the Git Log Command

[Git Log Docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log)

`git log` gives us a log of the commits in a given repository. If we have a longlist of logs, we want to be able to narrow down. 

For example, we can filter things out based on who wrote the commits, when they were committed, we can order them  differently.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215355472-544f10d8-3c61-4928-8308-60b87d8c31bd.png)

One option is `--oneline` ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215355516-590a1bb6-fa6b-4b2f-be11-a7713e07cc93.png)

This is why we should follow this pattern of having that first line in the commit message be the summary of the commit and then any other information comes afterwards separated by a blank line/return.

It's actually important to be able to do this because shortly we will be revisiting commits and we want to look at the history so that we can figure out where to time travel back to.

#  Committing With A GUI

Here, we look at how we can make a commit using a GUI such as GitKraken. Let's use our existing repo, `first_Project`.

First let's open it with GitKraken ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215356062-561dfb62-4956-4cee-b873-7630d5ffbe36.png)

Click on `Open a Repository` ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215356196-42ea2149-4e1f-47ca-9bec-1b7b1385eb09.png)

One opened, We will see our commit history. The bottom is the oldest and the one at the top is the latest commit.

# How to Make a New Commit in GitKraken

 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215356438-beff4a60-3fd5-405b-b464-bd915435b566.png)

At moment, we don't have any new changes that need commiting. So, I'll first make some changes. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215356527-a9950463-a3bb-4914-bdcb-4df62038e20f.png)

Now I have added some more information to two files.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215356566-71040981-773e-4709-b3ef-32ae85a44de7.png)

Now if we go back to GitKraken, it says 2 file changes in working directory. To see the changes, can either click on `View changes` or click on WIP (Work In Progress). 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215356651-db518f40-10cd-4847-ac0d-be817e0d3ea4.png)

The pencil icon means something was modified. If we added a file to the repo, we will see a green plus symbol next to the added file. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215356770-d3efe4bc-9254-4813-b903-2c36c21a9660.png)

If I click on `Stage File`, that will send that file to the staging area and we can see that from Git Bash too ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215356858-0668ca95-98b9-454d-8440-55d52cc17057.png)

So, instead of having to run `git add phase_one.txt` in the Git Bash Terminal, we clicked on `Stage File` in GitKraken. Does the same thing.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215357188-56ac9fc8-ff22-434d-9fbb-93ee11e218e0.png)

Then add commit message in the `Summary` section and then clcik on `Commit changes to 1 file`.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215357286-78c71bff-f7da-4a70-b068-6e3c3cc7cbd3.png)

We'll see the commit in the GitKraken timeline and also if we run `git status`, this change does not show anymore and if we run `git log`, we will see the new commit.

---

In the same way, we can add multiple changes to the staging area.

# Fixing Mistakes With Amend

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215357438-5ec9124d-8ffa-4ab1-a6d5-77254df67e60.png)

An example of  when you might want to amend a commit is where you create a new commit and then realize just a moment too late that you forgot to include a relevant file in the commit. Another example is you make a commit and then you read over the commit message and you realize too late that you have a typo. You wrote something wrong in that commit message.

There are a couple of ways of fixing these issues. But the easiest one, the one we are covering now in this section, is to amend the commit.

This allows us to edit, redo, or update just the previous commit. So this doesn't work if you made a mistake ten commits ago.

`--amend` is going to redo the previous commit. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215360219-f1a92a89-cb0c-4293-b6ad-19cce5d7d0c1.png)

The above is what the [docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) say on `--amend`.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215360311-52df596e-e279-4d48-8207-c4f7a3927a1f.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215360330-e748acd7-3c02-4e0e-a331-3c574bbf956f.png)

Let's add a title to each of our documents in te repo. and then let's add them to staging area ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215360387-3806c332-25d8-4837-85a5-0ece86ef4345.png)

But let's say we forgot to add the Welcome.txt file to the staging area too and just commited the `phase_one.txt` file ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215360475-a3a6da68-eceb-45c3-9155-257801453609.png)

And when we run `git status` we see that we forgot to add the `Welcome.txt` file.

---

So we can use that `--amend` option to add this file to that commit. First we will `add` this `Welcome.txt` file as normal ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215360563-e2de76f8-22c0-4a13-91ce-5711e7e1887d.png)

and then we run `git commit --amend`. This will open our default text editor ... 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215360621-524af1d1-0cec-4691-846c-3c52178ad357.png)

And it opens up the previous commit message and this allows me to edit that commit message. So if I had a typo in here, I could change it. That's another the reason for amending. You might not want to stage any new files. You might just want to fix a commit message. Just run `git commit --amend` and then you will be able to fix the typo. 

However, in our above example, we don't want to change the message, we just want to add a file to that commit. So, just save the message as it is and close the file. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215360739-542537ee-25d2-44b3-b6e0-4789c393c423.png)

Now it says 2 files changed, previously it was 1 file.  

---

To summarise: there's two reasons to do this. One is to include files, changes that you forgot that you somehow messed up in the previous commit. 

The other option is just to redo the commit message, or you could do both of them at the same time. You just need to run `git run --amend` and that allows you to redo the previous commit

# Ignoring Files w/ .gitignore

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215361136-96d6740c-62cf-4ec9-ab54-1693e40fb2b6.png)

There may be some files and directories that you don't want Git to know about or to track. SO, when you push your repo to GitHub, by using `.gitignore`, we can keep the files we want not to be shared, locally on our machhine, 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215361318-db21f0cd-02c9-4379-99f6-bacac9f724bc.png)

`.gitignore` is a hidden file that we create. And we can really put it anywhere in a repository, but traditionally we'll put it in the root of the repository, i.e. the top of it.

We create a file with a name of `.gitignore`, Git will look for that file and inside of it we can tell get what to ignore.

We can:

* Put exact file names. So, if we stated to ignore a filenamed .DS_Store, Git will ignore that file. 
* We can give it folder names by putting a slash at the end.
* Patterns: so for example, `*.log` will ignore files which have an extension of `.log`. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215361915-c4909e05-f580-437b-bcc7-37a7067a3751.png)

Many GitHub projects will have a `.gitignore` file. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215361943-684d9fa8-294b-4fab-a441-c478129d073a.png)

Inside it, we will see files and folders which are being ignored. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215362009-2ff4f192-38b8-49e7-92a0-1eee72180a65.png)

An example is, let's make a folder called gitIgnoreDemo.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215362079-46d8797a-49e2-490e-893e-d493d98fb5ba.png)

And then I move into it and create a few file with some information in them each. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215362399-540067aa-aefc-440f-83b5-938e3ab85071.png)

Then I initilize my repo. So, we want `secrets.txt` to stay untracked but commit the rest.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215362499-c3582ea2-0d39-4b13-9b36-ea9f0c98f623.png)


So, we need to create a `.gitignore` file and edit it ina text editor to include the names of te files you want Git to ignore ...

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215362526-68046236-de76-4674-889d-d61a097c3d2f.png)

Now if we run `git status`, we won't see the secrets file but we will see the `.gitignore` file.

---


Now we can run `git add .` and our secrets file won't be included. Now if we make changes to the files in the `.gitignore` file, Git ignores them.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215362685-a6fa7ed8-c06c-43f2-8cb0-270f5c0a9d77.png)

Here, I have made some changes to the secret.txt file and then ran `git status` but it still shows as `nothing to commit, working tree clean`.
