[Git Docs](https://git-scm.com/)

Here, you can find the Git Docs. Then will see this page ...

This is the Reference page. There are lots of options for every single one of the git commands.

So, if you ever come across an option being used with a git command, you can see here what it means.

Can also  go to the book section ...

# Keeping Your Commits Atomic

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215350807-72cab1e5-ec3e-4b5f-ac16-74687687a8d8.png)

What this means is, try and keep each commit focused on a single thing. It's super important to keep things as atomic as possible, to keep each commit focused on one thing. This does not mean one file, rather it means one feature, one thing that you worked on.

This matters a lot when you're working on code, especially when you're working with a team of people,

# Commit Messages: Present Or Past Tense?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215351788-12f16801-f390-4944-a3cf-c8b4e0dfcbec.png)

The git documentation officially recommends that you use present tense imperative style commit messages.

So present tense meaning verbs like "make something or "change x", "fix x" instead of past tense "fixed", "changed", or "updated". Example of imperative can be seen from the above slide. 

Can use past tense but convention is present or imperative. Keep in mind what others at your organisation are used to adapting and follow that. 

Below are some articles on this matter:

# Escaping VIM & Configuring Git's Default Editor

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215353017-34676319-3d53-411b-a312-197b1277cfc8.png)

To commit a change, if we only use `git commit`, it will open up the vim editor ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215353043-0695ee3e-5c71-4a31-80a1-0bd95cbdab19.png)

It is asking you for a commit message. to add it, press `i` and enter your message. Here, I have written `Updated Welcome.txt`.

Then exit by pressing the `escape` key, `:`, `x!`.

Then our commit message is added.

Sometimes, using the `-m` option with `git commit` might not be the best as we might want to add a lot more text as the message, for example, multiple lines. 


So, what we want to do is configure the `git commit` so that when it is run without the `-m` message, it will open up an editor of our choice.

To set the editor to Visual Studio COde, use `git config --global core.editor "code --wait"`

We are using `--global` so that this change applies to every repo, not just the current repo.

When we run it, we won't see any change but now let's make another change.

I've made some changes to the Welcome.txt file and have added them too. So, now it is ready to be commited.

Now when I run `git commit`, Visual Studio Code is opened up instead of vim.

This is my multi-line commit message and then close the file and go back to git bash ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215353930-c217fa15-bc88-4e9a-9f01-fcff702ce9ae.png)

I can now see that the commit has been made ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215353957-1f77c20b-e1b8-450a-9504-a8cacdad58b1.png)

> Remember: Once you start working on larger projects, it's definitely important to be able to open up and write messages in an editor. You can do that by using `git commit`.

# Closer Look at the Git Log Command

[Git Log Docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-log)

`git log` gives us a log of the commits in a given repository. If we have a longlist of logs, we want to be able to narrow down. 

For example, we can filter things out based on who wrote the commits, when they were committed, we can order them  differently.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215355472-544f10d8-3c61-4928-8308-60b87d8c31bd.png)

One option is `--oneline` ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215355516-590a1bb6-fa6b-4b2f-be11-a7713e07cc93.png)

This is why we should follow this pattern of having that first line in the commit message be the summary of the commit and then any other information comes afterwards separated by a blank line/return.

It's actually important to be able to do this because shortly we will be revisiting commits and we want to look at the history so that we can figure out where to time travel back to.

#  Committing With A GUI

Here, we look at how we can make a commit using a GUI such as GitKraken. Let's use our existing repo, `first_Project`.

First let's open it with GitKraken ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215356062-561dfb62-4956-4cee-b873-7630d5ffbe36.png)

Click on `Open a Repository` ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215356196-42ea2149-4e1f-47ca-9bec-1b7b1385eb09.png)

One opened, We will see our commit history. The bottom is the oldest and the one at the top is the latest commit.

# How to Make a New Commit in GitKraken

 ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215356438-beff4a60-3fd5-405b-b464-bd915435b566.png)

At moment, we don't have any new changes that need commiting. So, I'll first make some changes. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215356527-a9950463-a3bb-4914-bdcb-4df62038e20f.png)

Now I have added some more information to two files.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215356566-71040981-773e-4709-b3ef-32ae85a44de7.png)

Now if we go back to GitKraken, it says 2 file changes in working directory. To see the changes, can either click on `View changes` or click on WIP (Work In Progress). 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215356651-db518f40-10cd-4847-ac0d-be817e0d3ea4.png)

The pencil icon means something was modified. If we added a file to the repo, we will see a green plus symbol next to the added file. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215356770-d3efe4bc-9254-4813-b903-2c36c21a9660.png)

If I click on `Stage File`, that will send that file to the staging area and we can see that from Git Bash too ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215356858-0668ca95-98b9-454d-8440-55d52cc17057.png)

So, instead of having to run `git add phase_one.txt` in the Git Bash Terminal, we clicked on `Stage File` in GitKraken. Does the same thing.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215357188-56ac9fc8-ff22-434d-9fbb-93ee11e218e0.png)

Then add commit message in the `Summary` section and then clcik on `Commit changes to 1 file`.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215357286-78c71bff-f7da-4a70-b068-6e3c3cc7cbd3.png)

We'll see the commit in the GitKraken timeline and also if we run `git status`, this change does not show anymore and if we run `git log`, we will see the new commit.

---

In the same way, we can add multiple changes to the staging area.
