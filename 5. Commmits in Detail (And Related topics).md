# Keeping Your Commits Atomic

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215350807-72cab1e5-ec3e-4b5f-ac16-74687687a8d8.png)

What this means is, try and keep each commit focused on a single thing. It's super important to keep things as atomic as possible, to keep each commit focused on one thing. This does not mean one file, rather it means one feature, one thing that you worked on.

This matters a lot when you're working on code, especially when you're working with a team of people,

# Commit Messages: Present Or Past Tense?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/215351788-12f16801-f390-4944-a3cf-c8b4e0dfcbec.png)

The git documentation officially recommends that you use present tense imperative style commit messages.

So present tense meaning verbs like "make something or "change x", "fix x" instead of past tense "fixed", "changed", or "updated". Example of imperative can be seen from the above slide. 

Can use past tense but convention is present or imperative. Keep in mind what others at your organisation are used to adapting and follow that. 

Below are some articles on this matter:
