# Merging Branches

After the last section, we are now familiar with branching and the basic branch commands like `git branch` and `git switch`. We're now going to see how we can combine changes between branches, in other words, how we can merge branches into one another.

In the part, will be covering 

1. Fast Forward Merges
2. Git merge
3. Resolving Merge Conflicts
4. Using VSCode to Resolve Conflicts

# An Introduction To Merging

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234891652-dc1db35b-02a5-42c6-913f-ad798f24dab5.png)

The whole idea here is that we can work on different things in parallel, but usually we want to incorporate some of what we've done into another branch. As we will need to combine the things we are doing, this is where merging comes in use.  

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234892363-5b8a10af-cb15-48c8-a315-f1c4d3da3891.png)

A really common workflow is to treat the **master**/**main** branch (some people call it trunk) as the source of truth or in other words, the the most stable build of an application where you don't want to screw anything up.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234894001-721f0ad7-4d74-4148-a6d1-43c8859e5bb0.png)

So people work on a **feature** branch. Then, that work can be incorporated back into the **master** branch if it's deemed appropriate.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234894215-5861ee36-859c-4741-b323-ef4dce628eaf.png)

So there's a couple of things that can be confusing about **merging**. They boil down to these two principles. 

* We merge branches, not specific commits. So, we don't pick one commit and a second commit and join them together. Rather, we merge branches.
* We always merge based on the current head branch. In other words, we **merge **to where we are to where **head** is.

---

# git merge 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234894882-b38d9ffe-e165-4d1f-8651-148401019f0a.png)

So here's a simple example. I have two branches in this example, a **master** branch and a **bugfixe** branch.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234895493-882f5d15-761b-43f9-a592-fbfe13ed405b.png)

And on this **bugfix** branch, which we can see down at the bottom, we have some commits. So, we have I've diverged/made a new branch from the **master** branch. And we have added two commits as I'm fixing this bug. 

And it's now time for me to merge that work into master. So we want those two commits (ones in blue) to be merged with **master** branch. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234896397-3e76960e-6f36-46e4-aec6-1ad2ead16260.png)

So the workflow here is to first switch or check out the branch that we want to merge the changes into. In other words, we need to move over to the receiving branch ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234896764-396d313e-2ee3-4aef-901e-55f941cb587a.png)

So that's what we do. We run `git switch master`, which will mean `head` now points to `master`.

---

And then the second step is to actually use the `git merge` command followed by a branch name. 

```
git merge <branch_name>
```

That will merge changes from this branch (bugfix) into the current branch (master) that we're on.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234899379-56134e94-2228-4949-affe-f53bfd056301.png)

So `git merge bugfix` will take the commits from `bugfix` and merge them into whatever branch we're on, which in these diagrams is `master`.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234899544-1d7437b9-f6f7-48c9-ba61-b99de956260e.png)

You can see that `master` is now pointing at this commit (at the bottom of slide).

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234900156-ba68f80d-c1fc-4749-84e4-9ca604ab7c05.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234900263-e1cf8837-e6a8-4ab3-9b6e-4f709bd57244.png)

Really, they're just commits with different pointers at different commits. It's just a chain of these commits, at least with the way this branch works. We had `master`, we branched off to `bugfix` and did two commits. Now all that we did when we merged was catch up. We moved master up to that same commit on the right.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234900622-60395dfb-efb5-40b4-81f6-bbb736f6d974.png)

This is called a `fast forward merge` because all we had to do for the `master` branch to catch up with `bugfix` was it had to just fast forward a couple of commits. There wasn't additional work on the master branch.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234901500-e7bbbaa4-477c-4968-9f5c-41dfeafee934.png)

Now sometimes there will be additional work. So there'll be additional commits in the `master` branch (the red dots connected via a black linein the above diagram) that don't exist on `bugfix` and that is trickier to merge and we'll look at that later on. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234902345-f1a0ae95-3589-4f93-91dc-06438c1e3f0f.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234902504-1c651425-a229-4c65-bdda-7063b5c106f5.png)

But for our first example, we're dealing with these `fast forward merges`. So you have two branches and one of the branches just has additional commits that the first branch doesn't have. So to catch up, it's just a matter of moving that pointer forward ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234902595-ab1f645a-0063-4eaa-8569-3b3513bd0eda.png)

So that's what the `git merge` command does in this example. So, `git merge bugfix`, if we're on the master branch, moves that pointer up to `bugfix`.

So now `master` has all that history. It has the work that it had from before, but also the work from `bugfix`.

---

# Performing A Fast Forward Merge

The first step is to switch to the destination branch we're merging into. In the above case, `master`. 
Then run `git merge <branch_name>` with `branch_name` equalling the branch we want to merge in to `master`.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234907250-5d305227-ba0a-4d67-ba9c-22c4a5210fa9.png)

Now let's have a practise at this. 

So over here on our playlist example, we have quite a few branches.

---

# git branch -v 

We can use 

```yaml
git branch -v
```

we get a little bit more information, such as the last commit, the tip of the branch, and the commit message and the branch name.  In our example:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234910385-3c89bd13-5e17-4052-8d9b-7a34fdb11651.png)

If we switch back to master:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234913784-3b453be6-d243-48d0-a72c-e4d14dbfeb9f.png)

it only has two songs. 

---

Then we have the `older_songs` branch which I think I'm going to merge into master. First let's take a look at `older_songs`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234917449-44aef023-40b1-44f5-81fc-8345f33b7c30.png)

So it has some additional content.

---

master log: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234918806-e50151b1-56e0-4f14-9ec8-6b3ebfd0e5d0.png)

older_songs log:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234918980-72278372-8fca-4013-a325-d49a498473b9.png)

---

Anyway, I want to merge my `older_songs` branch into `master`. So I can get all of the extra stuff from `older_songs` branch into my `master` branch.

--- 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234919900-ad58b4bd-c6a3-4bd8-86c1-9b1a165f8390.png)

First thing is to move into the `master` branch. Then we will run:

```yaml
git merge <branch_want_to_merge_intp_master>  
```

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234920392-adb2e03f-6459-4379-9817-07c8903b0af8.png)

Close the file in VSCode ... 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234920511-2c960415-656b-42fe-ae5f-da62431475b0.png)

We can see the files from `older_songs` have been moved into the `master` branch.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234921124-0853e955-66c7-4da5-a5e9-fd0988a75b25.png)

And when we run `git log`, we can see that we had the first commits that we always had
on this branch, but now we have these other commits that came from the `older_songs` branch. 

And that is our first successful merge. We merge the content that commits from `older_songs` branch on to `master` branch.

Now a very important note is that we still have the `older_songs` branch. It doesn't delete that branch, it's still there. So I could go back to `older_songs` branch and do something new and it would not exist on `master` branch.

---

# Visualizing Merges

In this section, we will use GitKraken as a way to visualize our branches and specifically to visualize the merging process.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/235158402-fa425a6a-39fc-405d-990f-48d8ff28e7c1.png)

This is what it currently looks like. After adding two Van Morrison songs in the `older_songs` branch, master has been merged with it at the top. 

---

Then will switch the `older_songs` branch ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/235160488-d527a923-5ece-431c-86cc-885e3678e693.png)

and add some more songs ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/235160763-5eab99c3-cbc7-4487-8d8b-d28ed7228b22.png)

Here, have added two WIngs songs.

---

Then will add and commit both of these songs to the `older_songs` branch ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/235161103-b274fd31-b699-48d1-bfe3-8de3e9ba3d4b.png)

This means Master no longer is up to date or in sync with the `older_songs` branch. Now the `older_songs` branch has a commit that master branch does not.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/235161589-a0cf3686-1a2c-407d-a77e-ed29e41acfe6.png)

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/235162585-6909738e-2f7d-4e1e-9015-d4adabb9d883.png)

Now if we go back to GitKraken, we can see that the `older_songs` branch is one commit ahead of `master`. We can see the commit message of Add 2 Wings songs next to the `older_songs` branch which we just did in the `older_songs` branch.

---

Let's make one more change to the `older_songs` branch. 

## Switching branch using GitKraken

> Note: we can switch branches in the terminal as we have been doing, but we can also switch by using GitKraken by clicking on `branch`...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/235164439-edd25469-c556-4322-93ae-4d5cfc05bcb8.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/235164860-46a9b170-9dc3-4887-add5-e5da23cbd1df.png)

We can see from the above that by selectiong the branch `older_songs`in Gitkraken, when we then run `git status` in the terminal, we are now indeed on the `older_songs` branch.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/235166020-9516e2f6-dc81-4c50-a361-cca6d5f408fd.png)

Here we have added two Joni Mitchell songs and commited them. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/235166422-243f5974-baf7-4358-8df0-1758aa880e7b.png)

We can  now see that the `older_songs` branch has two more commits than `master`. 

So this sets us up for what we've already seen a fast forward merge. If we then want to merge the changes from the `older_songs` branch into `master`, it's pretty straightforward. All we need to do is add the two extra commits from the `older_songs` branch to `master`.

---

So now let's merge them.

First go to the destination branch, in this case the `master` branch, and then we merge with `git merge <branch_name>`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/235173317-e38b142c-d4c4-420a-bf22-03735270e4c3.png)

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/235173755-9a252878-f942-47e9-b0a2-37a690edbd2d.png)

Can now see that `master` has catched up with the `older_songs` branch.

---

# Generating Merge Commits

Remember: not all marriages are fast forward marriages. Here, you will see an example of that in this video.

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/6e069862-2139-4871-8735-911ddb61de54)

Imagine you're on a team of two people and you have your master branch on a project and then you create your own branch to fix a bug or try some experiment. And you're working over there for a few hours and then you're happy with it and you want to merge it back in to the master branch.

---

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/ff04ee3f-08a9-429c-adea-d8b83dc0f85c)

But then you realize, my teammate has already done some work on the master branch since I created my branch.

So there's a commit or several commits on the `master` branch that I don't have on my branch, `Bugfix`. So when I try and merge it's no longer a fast forward. Now there's new information that I don't have on `Bugfix` and there's information on `Bugfix` that `master` does not have.

We use the exact same commands but Git may not be able to do it automatically. It depends on the particulars of our commits and if there's conflicting information.

For example, what happens if on the `master` branch my teamate edited line 59 of a file and on the `Bugfix` branch I edited the same line to be something else. Which one wins when there's a conflict? That's something we're going to address in the next section.

For now, we will show going to show you an example where we don't arrive at a conflict, and instead Git is able to make the merge for us automatically.

---

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/70296508-3f04-4ad9-8392-04a9049cbf1d)

So what happens when it's not a fast forward merge. Something called a merge commit is generated (where the red arrow is).
Basically get just makes a commit for us on the branch that we're merging into the recipient branch, in other words, It makes a new commit for us and it will prompt us to include a message.

Note: Every commit has a parent commit (which is the commit before it). However, the new merge commit, (the commit where the red arrow is pointing), is the first we have seen where a commit has two different parent commits. This is something that will come up later on anyway.

---

To demonstrate this, we will make a new repo with some of the songs we have been using so far. And then move into it: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/0f1ade89-69aa-4894-89a3-04722f819309)

---

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/21efff58-91cd-4bcb-bf09-d15d90caa871)

And then I will initilize the repo and create a file called `songs.txt`. 

---

And then I'm going to open this up in my editor:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/29e02840-05f3-4e68-9aba-33c01087c31e)

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/f8f02902-044e-4aa0-9f81-d6040af8da02)

---

And we will then commit the latest changes using `add` and `commit` with a comment:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/7646bc57-2570-40e7-858f-a6946a435415)

---

Then I added two songs to the file in the VSCode and saved the file. Can see on Git that the chnages have not yet been staged:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/0d5084ce-d7fb-4e1b-b616-6b0806c73ad6)

---

Then will opned this repo in GitKraken so we can see it visually:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/02b60488-3dae-427d-b6f2-67b7fe4273c7)

---

Just to recap, we can commit the stages from GitKraken too. First click on `Stage all changes` on the right:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/56ca0001-25e5-417e-96bd-1a45169c12df)

Then add a Summary, in this case "Add 2 ABBA songs" and click on `Commit changes to 1  file`. 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/95e3e043-52dd-4672-95f1-31265537017a)

---

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/4714582e-4e82-4570-aad3-44a1677f04d3)

Now can see that I am on the `master` branch. 

---

So I'm now going to branch off from this `master` branch and I'll make a branch called `ABBA`. It's going to include more ABA songs, so I'll go ahead and do that in VSCode. 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/5d07599d-68ee-4159-b106-581a34b8c7ee)

In the above, I have created a branch called ABBA and switched into it.

---

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/67af097b-407f-499e-b30f-b9e42c359e52)

And then I'll stage them and then commit them using GitKraken. 

---

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/2e69a16d-28a1-4669-86bb-30ebc3e438c8)

Then we can see the branch has been updated

---

Then we will add one more song ...

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/d6624a40-439d-4ad2-baf2-bb24a30b518c)

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/5ce2bf08-7214-4baa-8b1f-4361c4d6d44f)

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/e18b4e44-8db6-4d48-8e94-238286f14845)

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/f2a24f33-2ca0-4434-a5f3-32d59512dadb)

Now we have two commits on `master` branch and two additional commits on the `ABBA` branch. If i merged into `master` now from `ABBA` branch, it will be a simple forward merge.

But I'm going to `master` and do some more work. To do this, I first will switch over to `master` branch:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/21398f30-3668-43d4-b5a3-20044e0dfa69)

---

Let's add a completely new file to `master`. Remember we said we can run into conflicts which complicate things. We'll show that in the next section. So that's why I'm going to do it in a separate file.

Maybe I want a playlist for podcasts, so I'm going to make a podcast file on the `master` branch:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/5c918c7b-5436-4216-9dbc-a7464ffb8fb3)

We can see from above that the podcasts.txt file is now being also displayed on VSCode on the right.

---

I'll also make a commit just to commemorate that a new file has been created. I'll do it this time from the command line.

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/2c082ec7-08c8-46b5-bcdb-a240ee49961c)

---

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/95b347fe-4266-4e60-9df7-80b99cdf9b06)

Now back in GitKraken, we see now `master` has this new commit that the `ABBA` branch does not know about.

The `ABBA` branch knows about the first four commits (from bottom). But now `master` has a new commit (the top one) and so merging is going to be slightly different. It's not a fast forward as we've discussed.

---

I am just going to add one commit to thr `master` branch by going to the `podcast.txt` file and add something. I'll doing this by double clicking on the podcasts file on VSCode:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/ff5d9493-6606-48d8-952d-43f0f727d2fb)

---

I then add and commit these changes via the command line:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/eb8f1b26-fbce-4a95-bebb-913f223c7a7b)

---

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/7fcdc6c8-6abd-4743-9965-a410321b8a3d)

So, now on the `master` branch, we have two commits (the top two) that `ABBA` doesn't know about, and on `ABBA` we have two commits (the middle two) that `master` (top `master`) doesn't know about.

---

So then, I will switch to the `master` branch and then I'll merge the `ABBA` branch in to `master` branch.

AFTER:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/818e3f37-7e38-42c0-8abb-ab5626a69792)

Take a look at this. It opened up my editor because I've set my default text editor in Git to be VSCOde, and it's waiting for me to close that file.

You can edit the commit message in VSCode, usually, I just leave this alone because you're just merging the branch and that's pretty self explanatory.

And to finally commit, close the `MERGE_MSG` file in VSCode:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/01878aff-4a12-4ff7-ace1-edf52cfa6e8f)

Once we click on the `X`, the below happens automatically:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/619e7314-8186-4625-9999-e2b3a71f4da7)

---

Then let's take a look overon GitKraken. What do we see now:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/c0f3fccd-3ce1-448c-ad78-8ef0627c1299)

This line is new. And a new commit right there that says "Merge branch `ABBA`.

---

I can also view this with `git log` on the command line.

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/ed4fe26b-5fb3-4eba-8e39-d725960df201)

I'm on the `master` branch.

We can see I have the original `master` commits and then I have the commits from our `ABBA` branch and then the mergeing of them commit.

---

So that's an example of a non fast forward merge where things were still automatically merged. I just had to provide a message. There was no conflicting changes. There was no problems that arose.

For example, I wasn't changing two things in the same file. Git was able to figure out to merge in that new stuff into the actual `songs` file and keep the podcast changes that are on the `master` branch already.

---

So that's one example of a merge commit.

In the next part, we will look at what happens when there is a conflict and how we resolve that.

---

# Merge Conflicts

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/fc7cb3c9-62f0-46eb-b377-836e061e8640)

When we merge two branches, as we've seen Git will do its best to automatically merge those changes, whether it's a fast forward or needs to make a merge commit as we saw in the last section, it tries to do things automatically. So far it's succeeded in the two examples we've seen.

But if we had conflicting changes, for example, on one branch, somebody modified a file and on a second branch that we're merging, somebody deleted the same file. 

Or another situation would be if on one branch I edit one line 77 of some file and somebody else on the other branch edits the same line 77 in the same file, Git doesn't know how to automatically merge that.

How does it decide what to keep and what to get rid of? So this is where merge conflicts come up. You have to manually resolve them.

---

Let's see the process first.

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/f07a63f9-e253-451a-8685-9fafa90414dd)

When you run `git merge` and if there are conflicts, you'll see something like the above message saying `Conflict` and then `Merge conflict` in some file `automatic merge failed`, `fix the conflicts and then commit the result`.

So this is a multi step process. Git tells us there's conflicts, then we have to go and open the files where there are conflicts and fix them and then we commit those changes.

---

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/cfd2c9c8-e517-44d8-aeab-e27a6f3d4e2a)

So the files where there are conflicts, are actually decorated. They have new content to indicate where there are conflicts. So when we open up a file, we'll see this weird stuff in their `HEAD` and then a branch name.

---

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/e0d9431a-1053-4b1d-a063-3f48b0e16d90)

So what these markers indicate is what content came from my `HEAD` branch, (the branch I'm on, in other words, the recipient branch I'm trying to merge into). This content is between the `<<<<<<<HEAD` and the `=======`.

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/ba927fc4-731e-467a-9f82-ff968cb46322)

And the content from the branch you are trying to merge from is displayed betwen the `======` and `>>>>>>` symbols.

So it's my job now to delete or keep both, figure out which part I want, which part I don't want. It's totally up to me. I resolve it and then I get rid of these conflict markers, these symbols:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/3c765c82-c4c9-40f2-951b-ce1e807716ae)

and then I save the file and then I go back and `add` and `commit` the changes.

---

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/37af10bf-985d-423f-93ed-94e07f43954a)

So here's a step by step guide. 

See the next section for a demo.

---

# 59. Resolving Merge Conflicts

In this section, we're going to demonstrate generating a merge conflict and then resolving it.

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/f2a4d3e6-528a-44cd-9a69-4f2415475523)

I'm going to keep working with our simple repository. Currently it has two branches, `master` and `ABBA`, but I'm actually going to delete the `ABBA` branch because I merged in those changes and let's say I'm done with it, so I'm going to delete it.

There's a couple of ways of doing it.

---

## Delete a Branch - git branch -d <name_of_branch> 

To delete a branch, run:

```yaml
git branch -d ABBA
```

and make sure you're not on that branch. We can check which branch we are on by running:

```yaml
git branch
```

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/202bae03-5fe2-41fb-ba49-9c1c52ee8819)

---

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/f8acde4b-9a95-49a0-bd05-e018220add7d)

Can now see that the `ABBA` branch has been deleted.

Because I had already all of the changes merged into `master`, so it doesn't warn me.

---

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/e321fa35-6bed-4403-ae87-18ca8b88d043)

So now we have just the `master` branch.

Now, what I'm going to do to demonstrate merge conflicts is I'm going to make two branches. One for our friend Boyd and another for our friend Serena.

And they're going to each have their own branch where they can make their own playlist for the road trip, and they're definitely not going to agree. So they'll make their own playlist on their own branch, and then I'll merge them together when we're ready for our road trip.

---

So I'll start by making Serena's branch, so I'll do it in one go:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/8db06a5e-0877-4a0d-a315-228674b32ff0)

Then moved backedto `master` branch so I can make the other branch:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/63545464-64a7-4647-937d-0979a4d39c73)

---

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/82f58d95-e7f7-40dd-8b23-afef4c383488)

Now we have three branches, two which we just made, `serena` and `boyd` and they're all referring to the same spot that `master` currently is.

Currently, we are on the `boyd` branch, so let's work on his branch first. 

---

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/241e3665-25cf-4a37-8bc1-aa656fae3e77)

Bjorn really does not like ABBA that much, but he likes Dancing Queen, so he's going to keep Dancing Queen:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/ef3767f2-0e77-4dee-a55f-258d58b8dd55)

---

Then we're going to add some music in that Bjorn does.

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/9de767cc-9e04-496f-ba35-76fe74047998)

---

He then makes a commit 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/1f31c09d-fdfb-4bdd-b84f-25dd3c87d3b6)

---

Boyd also likes another two songs, so adds them to the file: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/5c1b739f-8d5f-4318-85ff-1722424712b9)

and then commits them:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/01fafca3-c690-4df6-b638-1f6ee72c9258)

Here, is what the log in the `boyd` branch looks like so far: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/b9115974-4eb4-49ef-b639-4b70672c2ad7)

---

Then simultaneously, Serena is working on her branch and she likes ABBA quite a bit. She even goes as far as to add another Abba song in. 

First, let's switch to the `serena` branch:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/3dc90c46-3b94-41cd-a893-82e0c703483f)

---

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/e7946982-3756-43a9-bed8-6f6f15be656d)

This is what her log looks like so far.

---

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/89d73a99-4727-46c8-8fa4-b8fe552c0ceb)

The above is what she adds to her branch, and then makes a commit: 

Before commiting:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/44489bdd-bc28-4ecd-b5aa-972b1dd85e91)

After commiting: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/0b70721a-b9c3-42bd-a496-9503cf796fd6)

---

Then she adds one more song: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/b8124b0a-ca95-444d-ae65-0ccf017f8783)

And then the adds and commits that change

Before commiting:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/c343afea-efff-4d38-8d34-9c8b4d03f9c1)

After commiting: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/111f8322-e13d-4a71-8660-2fe4342cdfec)

---

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/134a6f98-a971-42fe-bd6c-b7d4a1619fb0)

Ignore from bottom to the point where the yellow arrow is pointing towards. We can see that the serena branch has two commits which are not on `master` nor the `boyd` branch. And likewise, `boyd` has two commits which are not on `master` nor the `serena` branch. 

Here, there are conflicts as both, serena and boyd are editing the same file. 

Boyd's file:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/8eec8046-f45f-4c4e-9966-93e022502b84)

Serena's file: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/a2c17101-b322-4ac2-8c67-5ce9bcef3dcc)

They have different versions of the same file. So when I try and merge the two, we're going to run into an issue.

So now I have to decide where I want to do the merging. Do I want them to still have separate branches and just continue to have separate branches? If so, maybe I'll make a third branch. I'll name this third branch `combo`:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/8de4928f-afd4-4ed8-9718-795b8ba172b2)

And I'm branching from `boyd`. That's where I am now. So, it will include all the stuff from `boyd` and then I can merge in the changes from `serena`.

---

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/360d5e27-c69f-4146-a9c3-32f60366aaa2)

So now I have this new `combo` branch, it's at the same spot as `boyd`. They're referencing the same commit.

---

Now I'm going to merge in `serena`:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/b64728d8-30eb-4b80-9f98-55341574db56)

We can see that it tries to auto-merge, but then it throws an error. 

---

So, then we go to our editior, in our case, VSCode: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/5013b14f-0997-41b5-97bd-477a94a63d25)

and we can see the headers and markings we mentioned in the previous section. 

From `<<<<<<< HEAD (Current Change` to `======` is what we had on the branch originally. In our case it was the `combo` branch so we can see it. It's Boyd's changes.

And in the blue section, these are the changes we have coming in from the `serena` branch. 

And I have to decide, do I want just Serena's stuff? Do I want Jess Boyd's? No, I want both.

---

So what I'm going to do is I'm going to delete these markers: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/eb000374-0407-4da1-b3d9-3ce5e6f4410b)

---

And then I delete duplicates, in this case `Dancing Queen - ABBA`:

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/2cef778a-c16f-41b0-8b29-75bc3ec15069)

And otherwise I think everything is unique. The point is, it's up to me. It's totally up to me what I want to keep and don't keep.

---

Once happy with changes, save the file. 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/cd759977-f614-4c58-bfa4-22b887e5552f)

So we have already done the first three steps, now we need to add and then commit the changes: 

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/c12de851-d30c-4f30-8fc5-909795443f1a)

This commit is us merging and resolving those conflicts.

---

So now let's head over to our little visualization here.

![image](https://github.com/NwCoder21/Git-and-Github/assets/107522496/eef40036-12c3-4d57-a482-39e2da6e56cf)

It looks exactly the same as what we had earlier. It's the same process, right? We merged the `serena` branch, into `combo` and we have this new merge commit (at the top). The difference is that we had to do some work to make that commit. We actually had to dig into a file and make some changes.
 
Now that conflict has been resolved and we're on our new branch `combo`, which includes the commits that it had earlier from `boyd` and the new commits from `serena` and the conflicts there that we manually resolved.

---

# Using VSCode To Resolve Conflicts

Another example of resolving conflicts. But this time, I'm going to show you how to do it using VSCode.
