# Merging Branches

After the last section, we are now familiar with branching and the basic branch commands like `git branch` and `git switch`. We're now going to see how we can combine changes between branches, in other words, how we can merge branches into one another.

In the part, will be covering 

1. Fast Forward Merges
2. Git merge
3. Resolving Merge Conflicts
4. Usinf VSCode to Resolve Conflicts

# An Introduction To Merging

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234891652-dc1db35b-02a5-42c6-913f-ad798f24dab5.png)

The whole idea here is that we can work on different things in parallel, but usually we want to incorporate some of what we've done into another branch. As we will need to combine the things we are doing, this is where merging comes in use.

A really common workflow is to treat the **master**/**main** branch (some people call it trunk) as the source of truth or in other words, the the most stable build of an application where you don't want to screw anything up.

So people work on a **feature** branch. Then, that work can be incorporated back into the **master** branch if it's deemed appropriate.

So there's a couple of things that can be confusing about **merging**. They boil down to these two principles. 

* We merge branches, not specific commits. So, we don't pick one commit and a second commit and join them together. Rather, we merge branches.
* We always merge based on the current head branch. In other words, we **merge **to where we are to where **head** is.

So here's a simple example. I have two branches in this example, a **master** branch and a **bugfixe** branch.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234895493-882f5d15-761b-43f9-a592-fbfe13ed405b.png)

And on this **bugfix** branch, which we can see down at the bottom, we have some commits. So, we have I've diverged/made a new branch from the **master** branch. And we have added two commits as I'm fixing this bug. 

And it's now time for me to merge that work into master. So we want those two commits (ones in blue) to be merged with **master** branch. 

---

So the workflow here is to first switch or check out the branch that we want to merge the changes into. In other words, we need to move over to the receiving branch ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234896764-396d313e-2ee3-4aef-901e-55f941cb587a.png)

So that's what we do. We run `git switch master`, which will mean `head` now points to `master`.

---

And then the second step is to actually use the `git merge` command followed by a branch name. 

```
git merge <branch_name>
```

That will merge changes from this branch (bugfix) into the current branch (master) that we're on.

So `git merge bugfix` will take the commits from `bugfix` and merge them into whatever branch we're on, which in these diagrams is `master`.

You can see that `master` is now pointing at this commit (at the bottom of slide).

Really, they're just commits with different pointers at different commits. It's just a chain of these commits, at least with the way this branch works. We had `master`, we branched off to `bugfix` and did two commits. Now all that we did when we merged was catch up. We moved master up to that same commit on the right.

---

This is called a `fast forward merge` because all we had to do for the `master` branch to catch up with `bugfix` was it had to just fast forward a couple of commits. There wasn't additional work on the master branch.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234901500-e7bbbaa4-477c-4968-9f5c-41dfeafee934.png)

Now sometimes there will be additional work. So there'll be additional commits in the `master` branch (the red dots connected via a black linein the above diagram) that don't exist on `bugfix` and that is trickier to merge and we'll look at that later on. 

---

But for our first example, we're dealing with these `fast forward merges`. So you have two branches and one of the branches just has additional commits that the first branch doesn't have. So to catch up, it's just a matter of moving that pointer forward ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/234902595-ab1f645a-0063-4eaa-8569-3b3513bd0eda.png)

So that's what the `git merge` command does in this example. So, `git merge bugfix`, if we're on the master branch, moves that pointer up to `bugfix`.

So now `master` has all that history. It has the work that it had from before, but also the work from `bugfix`.
