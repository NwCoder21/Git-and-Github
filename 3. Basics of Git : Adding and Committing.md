This is what will be covered in this section. `Git Log` is also CRITICAL.

#  What Is A Git Repo?

Just because we have installed Git, this does not mean that Git is active or that we are using it. I have to manually tell Git when we want to use it and in which directories we have to create repositories.

So, if i'm working on a project, I need to tell Git to create a new repository. A repository is a Git workspace with its own history.

So every Git repo has its own history. They're not linked or connected in any way.

For example, I may have a bunch of folders which are different projects. Each one of these is a separate project. If I want to use Git, I have to go into each project folder and create a git repository.

And whatever happens in those folders, whatever get commands I run, whatever history I store with Git, they're completely separate and not connected.

This allows us to have different histories for each different project.

# Git init and Git Status 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213432460-1d091c76-2ab5-4861-a22e-6d926c0fc422.png)

Now let's learn how we instantiate a new repo using Git.

`git status` reports back to you the status in your current repository.

If we run git status at the moment, because we have not created a repo, an error will pop-up. Also, when using git status, we need to be in a repo. `git status` reports back to us and gives us information on the current repo we're in.

`git init` means initialize a new repository wherever we are in our terminal. So whatever directory I'm inside of will become the home of a new git repository.

Here, I have created a folder called `firstProject`. If i want to initilize this folder as a git repo, I need to move into it and then run the `git init` command.

Now that I have moved into it, if I run `git status`, because I still have not initilized this as a git repo, an error will show up.

If we now run `git init`, it says `Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/NwCod/Documents/firstProject/.git/`

NOTE: `git init` is something we run one time per project so we're not constantly initializing if we're working on the same project day after day.

We use `git init` once per project. After we have run it once, we don't need to keep running it.

Now if we run `git status`, we something different. This means something has happened. Will cover what this means later.

Next up, we're going to talk about what actually happens when I run `git init` and where is the git folder or files or what information does it create?

 # The `.Git` Folder

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213458482-2cf49163-fe9d-45f0-a297-9ee692c56d59.png)

When we run `git init`, what happens? The docs say:

```
"git-init - Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one"
```

When we run `git init`, it creates a directory called `.git`. Hidden files begin with `.`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213458764-5fb110ea-2a1b-4d96-a903-2c65f9214920.png)

wHen we initilized the firstProject folder, a folder was created but it is hidden. To see it, we need to use `ls -a`:

Now we can see the `.git` folder. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213459292-fd8f8a9a-7aa0-4cdc-b70d-23627de5bcb0.png)

Then we can move into it using `cd` and use `ls` to see what is inside of it. This is what we just initilized.

---

Note: if we remove the `.git` folder using `rm -rf`, it will delete the entire git history for this project.

---

This `.git` folder is where everything is held together of that repository.
This folder will be located in every git repository you initialize.
