# Basics of Git : Adding and Committing


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213430392-17869790-338c-40f5-a7b9-657f061b4d40.png)

This is what will be covered in this section. `Git Log` is also CRITICAL.

#  What Is A Git Repo?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213431270-de351986-1374-435c-b4aa-5198df531e68.png)

Just because we have installed Git, this does not mean that Git is active or that we are using it. I have to manually tell Git when we want to use it and in which directories we have to create repositories.

So, if i'm working on a project, I need to tell Git to create a new repository. A repository is a Git workspace with its own history.

So every Git repo has its own history. They're not linked or connected in any way.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213431383-0a8a93c2-df9c-46a1-becb-9bf106c8a838.png)

For example, I may have a bunch of folders which are different projects. Each one of these is a separate project. If I want to use Git, I have to go into each project folder and create a git repository.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213431703-f72c4118-8af0-4d80-8bf7-22bef79d7629.png)

And whatever happens in those folders, whatever get commands I run, whatever history I store with Git, they're completely separate and not connected.

This allows us to have different histories for each different project.

---

# Git init and Git Status 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213432460-1d091c76-2ab5-4861-a22e-6d926c0fc422.png)

Now let's learn how we instantiate a new repo using Git.

`git status` reports back to you the status in your current repository.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213432696-f2a892b0-5ebe-442e-9b27-20487bfe5f0d.png)

If we run git status at the moment, because we have not created a repo, an error will pop-up. Also, when using git status, we need to be in a repo. `git status` reports back to us and gives us information on the current repo we're in.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213433046-8ca3e720-0064-444b-80e9-e4f52d3b2787.png)

`git init` means initialize a new repository wherever we are in our terminal. So whatever directory I'm inside of will become the home of a new git repository.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213433660-06512417-934e-4011-a2c6-8428960febb6.png)

Here, I have created a folder called `firstProject`. If i want to initilize this folder as a git repo, I need to move into it and then run the `git init` command.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213434006-d5563caf-4314-45a0-8f5f-bbfe7767d9b9.png)

Now that I have moved into it, if I run `git status`, because I still have not initilized this as a git repo, an error will show up.

---
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213456891-4d370597-7354-42f3-8689-511bc1fded17.png)

If we now run `git init`, it says `Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/NwCod/Documents/firstProject/.git/`

NOTE: `git init` is something we run one time per project so we're not constantly initializing if we're working on the same project day after day.

We use `git init` once per project. After we have run it once, we don't need to keep running it.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213457171-a649e776-71ef-4944-9d69-ee376d589190.png)

Now if we run `git status`, we something different. This means something has happened. Will cover what this means later.

---

Next up, we're going to talk about what actually happens when I run `git init` and where is the git folder or files or what information does it create?

---

 # The `.Git` Folder

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213458482-2cf49163-fe9d-45f0-a297-9ee692c56d59.png)

When we run `git init`, what happens? The docs say:

```
"git-init - Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one"
```

When we run `git init`, it creates a directory called `.git`. Hidden files begin with `.`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213458764-5fb110ea-2a1b-4d96-a903-2c65f9214920.png)

wHen we initilized the firstProject folder, a folder was created but it is hidden. To see it, we need to use `ls -a`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213459109-6254484e-add2-44ef-a70a-abfa478d03a0.png)

Now we can see the `.git` folder. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213459292-fd8f8a9a-7aa0-4cdc-b70d-23627de5bcb0.png)

Then we can move into it using `cd` and use `ls` to see what is inside of it. This is what we just initilized.

---

Note: if we remove the `.git` folder using `rm -rf`, it will delete the entire git history for this project.

---

This `.git` folder is where everything is held together of that repository.
This folder will be located in every git repository you initialize.

---

# A Common Early Git Mistake

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213460366-3393f823-9550-44de-863b-ace575610297.png)

First, we need to understand that when we have a git repo, we initialize a git repo that's in one directory. In our example, it was the `firstProject` directory/folder. Git will watch everything that happens in this directory, including anything nested further down. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213463704-be924d7b-11bc-43ca-8ef2-a0f8367fa442.png)

Here, I am two levels down within the firstProjetc folder.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213463905-0946b605-c8b9-4f2f-9e79-b630bbd16f29.png)

Whislt even being two levels down, if i run `git status`, I still get feedback that says yes, you are in a git repo.

---

So, this is important to remember, any files and folders and changes I do in this directory for this one project (`firstProject`) are tracked by git if I initialized the repo like I did.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213464523-7d8cbc07-0e87-4eba-af86-bf66b8ac086b.png)

But also REMEMBER: we do not want to be initializing another repo inside of an existing repo. If we do his, git will get confused. 

So, to avoid this,  make sure BEFORE you run `git init`, make sure you're not in a repository and that's why we showed you to use `git status` first. `git status` will tell us if we are already in a repo or not.

---

As a rule; make a folder for a project and then initialize git in that folder. You don't want to have a git repo on your desktop or your documents folder or on your entire machine that's tracking everything. You could, but most people prefer to have one repo per project, so always run, `git status`, make sure you're not in a repo before you initialize.

If you do happen to end up with nested repos, you can sort it out by deleting one of the `.git` folders.

---

# The Committing Workflow Overview - `git commit`

Commiting is the most important git feature. So, what is committing or what is a `git commit`?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213466457-5d9601ad-a077-4fa6-bb8d-a15ee25b63b7.png)

Let's says each step is like a checkpoint. So, as we make progress in our project, we add checkpoints or a snapshot of the project and it's new changes along with a little message like `add top nav bar` or `add first row of content` or `finish bottom row of content`, or `change to dark theme`, etc.

Well, each one of these checkpoints is actually in Git, what we would call a `commit`. A `git commit` is one of these checkpoints in a git repository.

Later on, we'll learn how to go back to earlier commits, how to undo commits, how to just take a peek at an earlier commit. But for now, we're just going to focus on making these checkpoints.

---

For example, How do we add a new feature to a website and then make a commit and then repeat, do some more stuff, make a commit, do some more stuff, make a commit etc. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213469845-7dcfd23e-900e-4800-a168-7cae8e657879.png)

The next thing that's crucial to understand about making a commit is that it's not the same as just saving a file.

With commits, we have to make changes first and save them to our files before we can even commit. So we might use the term checkpoint or savepoint, but we're not talking about just saving a file, that has nothing to do with Git. We save files all the time, but once we have made changes to files, we can then group them together into a commit.

---

In the above silde, this is showing a potential commit that I may have made that includes changes to five or four different files, plus a folder called `Logos`. once I have saved my changes, and I can then group that all together into a new commit.

---

# The Basic Git Workflow 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213471020-b9d85bae-b178-4d9d-89df-f730e46b6758.png)

The next thing to know about making a commit is that it's actually a multistep process. It's not as simple as just hitting a button that commit. Instead, there's an intermediate step where we actually call out the particular changes that we've made that we want to include in a commit.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213471426-84269a8c-85ac-4f36-b480-865778bc2c68.png)

 This allows us to selectively make commits, which is helpful.

For example, imagine I've been working all day or all morning on some project. I spent a lot of time working on this project and I made changes to seven different files.

As you can see on the left hand side, I deleted a file, I modified two files, I created four files. Instead of just making one generic commit that just says checkpoint right now, instead I can actually call out some of these and group them together based upon the actual stuff that I did.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213471973-56bfe841-c2d7-46fd-8e4a-52d812b9f851.png)

For example, I might group together those first three changes. I deleted a file called `team.html` and then I changed two files called `about.html` and `about.css`, and added a some new team members to the `about` page. So, this was one commit.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213472559-a15099f9-d784-4a88-96c4-5f2daec21cd9.png)

And then I can take these other four changes and group them together into a separate standalone commit.

This is what it means when we say that ith git, there is an intermediate step where we can select certain changes, group them together, and make it commit with those changes.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213474391-dd5f4d8b-45e6-4165-ad4c-9c3777e7fd19.png)

To make a commit, we use two commands. One is `git add` and the second is `git commit`. We  use the `git add` in order to select those changes that we want to include in the upcoming commit.

---

To summarise; when we make one of these commits, we can call out the specific changes that we want to include in a commit, rather than just automatically including all changes in our project. We can select them first, which  is the first step, and then commit them.

Next, we will see how we use `git add` which is the first of two commands we use to make a commit.

---

# Staging Changes With Git Add


To make a commit, we use two commands because that allows us to separate out particular changes we've made. This allows us to group things together they way we want them to be grouped and this `git add` command is what allows us to do this. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213478000-5c27dcad-db57-467e-9d1a-df7e43276c11.png)

We use the `git add` command to stage the changes we have made 

So once we've done some work and we've actually made some changes, we then call those changes out using the `git add` command to stage them for a commit and then we can make a commit.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213478662-16ff3f37-d6c4-4e51-ad70-5cf7141bc754.png)

So, before we can do anything with Git, we need to make some changes. Let's create a file in our `firstProject` folder called `phase_one` and add some text to it using the vim editor. Can also use Visual Studio Code to edit it, 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213479959-0d9a8da3-1713-44c1-8807-86927237a41f.png)

Here, have added `Hello World!` and another line to the file.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213481111-74c3dceb-a5a6-4951-a3ef-f7896006eb33.png)

To view the contents of the file, we can use the `cat` command.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213481402-e538f788-67de-40d0-bdf6-b09d1ac89dab.png)

Now if we run git status, it will say untracked files and the name of the file. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213482186-fbde2716-e355-4d5f-875e-a1e186ac650c.png)

Let's say we then create another file called `Welcome` and add some text to it and then save the file. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213482683-3c3bf2c2-329f-4d5b-8c48-d27bc26458a1.png)

Now if we go back to terminal and run `git status`, it shows us that there are two files now that are untracked. In other words, git tells me there's two files that it's aware of, but it's not tracking.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213483920-f1561f0c-8d8a-45f5-bea4-60486e7c542e.png)

So, we have done step 1 which was to work on stuff and we want to make a commit.

---

# Working Directory, Staging Area and the Repository

These are three different location. They not not physical locations.

---

## Working Directory: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213484493-8baf2e4e-07a6-4744-a37d-e18afc76672b.png)

This is just a fancy way of referring to the directory, the place we're actually working on our project. So for me, my working directory is this my firstProject folder.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213484801-f9518452-ae99-49ab-bcae-f94865751fd8.png)

Currently, I have two files in my working directory.In other words, the working directory just refers to this directory where I'm working. In this case, i'm working in the `firstProject` direcotry/folder.

---

## Repository: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213486143-9c2d2da9-2742-431a-bdf3-18924b2e846a.png)

This is the `.git` folder we discussed earlier on. We can view it by using `ls -a` as it is hidden.

Once I actually make a commit, `git commit` changes what is in it. It actually adds new commits to this (`.git`) folder.
It actually adds new commits to this folder.
So when we actually make a commit, we are updating that folder, the actual git repository.

---

## Staging Area;

This is in between the working directory and the repository. This is where we add our changes to before we make a commit.

The below is another way to visulize it ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213487099-01102d1b-b4f9-4393-8bf0-51dc1aed9767.png)

In the working directory you can see a bunch of changes that I've made. Let's say I wanted to make my first commmit with those bottom fiur files that i have changed. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213487540-756ec09c-f088-43e9-9915-8d573501e549.png)

So I stage those changes first and I do that using the `git add` command.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213487678-9ff8009c-8917-4482-bb34-769839043eb6.png)

And then I can make a commit. When I make a commit, that is when I amupdating the `.git` folder. 

---

> so REMEMEBR: two commands, `git add` is just going to stage changes so that I then commit them using `gitcommit`.

---

# git add Syntax

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213490226-27000314-5f40-450c-8a3e-27551b47d6d3.png)

This is the syntax for `git add` and then one or more files we have changed. Now let's add our two files to the staging area ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213489821-43204cf9-2d41-4a35-acc5-7e3d957abd3e.png)

Here, used `git add Welcome.txt` to add the `Welcome.txt` to the staging area. 

---

Now let's run `git status` ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213490475-9010f0c5-7c9f-4581-82ac-aa980f3ee04f.png)

I haven't made it commit. All that I've done is stage the one file, the `Welcome.txt` file to be committed, but it's not yet committed.

So if I wanted to I could make a commit now with just that one file, the `Welcome.txt` file, that I changed. But I'm going to group them together because, you know, I worked on them together, the `Welcome.txt` file and the `phase_one.txt` file as they are connected together.

In other words, I want to group everything I've done so far on this project. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213491645-9fe0534f-bf35-49cb-9d70-3766316c0048.png)

So, now have added the `phase_one.txt` file to the staging area using `git add`. When I run git status now, can see both of them are now in the Staging area. 

Next we will be learning how to commit these files.

---

# The Git Commit Command!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213492155-f8b0e337-6ee5-42a2-82a7-41d5ea977978.png)

`git commit` is the command we actually use to make a commit using whatever changes we have previously staged.

Whenever we use `git commit`, Git expects us to include a message that describes or summarizes the changes included in that snapshot in the given commit.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213492902-fb457e8b-c355-4c0f-8156-a580a87a2f55.png)

In this example, we added a message which said `Add branded navbar`. So, remember, that a commit message should summarize the changes included in that commit.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213493251-a9db4850-5b41-4535-bedf-b2eaef450771.png)

If we just use `git commit`, it will make the commit with whatever changes have been staged. However, it's going to try and use your default editor, whatever your default editor is on your machine.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213493628-bc940431-8193-424f-9719-da4a4ca863c4.png)

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213493829-e56ceb29-479b-4327-8f35-91671ce5a4c7.png)

So, when using `git commit`, we use the `-m` option along with a comment in double quotes. get will use that message that we provide and make a commit with it. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213495058-e91d7429-ec19-4a84-b08f-e520e854f741.png)

So, here, I am ready to make my first commit.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213495348-5c14ade5-46c7-46d1-b84f-a4f25ae91b4f.png)

This is what happens. Let.s run `git status` ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213495536-9673706a-7454-4244-9166-6d3687c8aad8.png)

The phrase "working tree clean" means that basically everything I've done in my folder in the working directory git knows about and git has been tracking and it's up to date but as soon as I change a file, the working tree is no longer clean, which is not a bad thing.

---

Next up, we'll get more practice doing the same process. Change something, add and commit.

---

<!-- L30 - The Git Log Command (And More Committing) --> 

# The Git Log Command (And More Committing)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213575707-82c0c6e5-3a4f-4d3c-b027-3a213538d6e4.png)

Let's create another file called `week1.txt` in the `firstProject` folder. 

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213576034-b690e7c1-0199-4018-8f35-7f0d0901ec65.png)

I've added data to it via Visual Studio Code.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213576149-1d5b5cdb-1269-4f2d-93de-e8385d68fce8.png)

Now if we run `git status`, it tell us that that there is an untracked file called `week1.txt`.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213576416-b04c243c-7d98-44fd-8c89-c5622f6a6699.png)

And let's just add a `!` to the end of the `Welcome.txt` file, which is already a file which is being tracker by Git.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213576703-6dc91e20-7513-4a23-a3be-bda721080d87.png)

We can see, when we run `git status`, it says  `modified` for the `Welcome.txt` file and it says `untracked` for the new file which is `week1.txt`.

---

Unlike `week1.txt`, which is an untracked file, `Welcome.txt` has already been added and committed previously, so git knows about it and now knows that it has been modfied. 

---

If we wanted to include both in the next commit, we can send both of them to the staging area in one go using the `git add` command:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213577679-f5f28c33-99af-4144-9471-344768bcfd43.png)

Both files wil Update be included in the next commit, such as: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213577942-aacaff0f-779f-480f-a65c-5d201e4ac5f0.png)

Now we can see that both have been committed and nothing to commit now and working tree is clean.

# git log

`git log` is a commnd which doesn't do anything. It's much like `git status`. It just retrieves information. And the information it retrieves to us is a log of the commits for a given repository.

For example, when we run `git log` in the above screenshot, we can see 2 commits. And for each one you can see the author, the dates. The author and the email are things that you can configure and we did configure early on, so it just uses whatever your local git has configured for username and email.

And then we have the commit message.

The part highlighted in orange is the commit hash which we will cover later.

Another way to add multiple files to the staging area is by using `git add .`. For example, I have saved some more changes to both files
