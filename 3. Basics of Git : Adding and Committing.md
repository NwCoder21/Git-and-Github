This is what will be covered in this section. `Git Log` is also CRITICAL.

#  What Is A Git Repo?

Just because we have installed Git, this does not mean that Git is active or that we are using it. I have to manually tell Git when we want to use it and in which directories we have to create repositories.

So, if i'm working on a project, I need to tell Git to create a new repository. A repository is a Git workspace with its own history.

So every Git repo has its own history. They're not linked or connected in any way.

For example, I may have a bunch of folders which are different projects. Each one of these is a separate project. If I want to use Git, I have to go into each project folder and create a git repository.

And whatever happens in those folders, whatever get commands I run, whatever history I store with Git, they're completely separate and not connected.

This allows us to have different histories for each different project.

# Git init and Git Status 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213432460-1d091c76-2ab5-4861-a22e-6d926c0fc422.png)

Now let's learn how we instantiate a new repo using Git.

`git status` reports back to you the status in your current repository.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213432696-f2a892b0-5ebe-442e-9b27-20487bfe5f0d.png)

If we run git status at the moment, because we have not created a repo, an error will pop-up. Also, when using git status, we need to be in a repo. `git status` reports back to us and gives us information on the current repo we're in.

`git init` means initialize a new repository wherever we are in our terminal. So whatever directory I'm inside of will become the home of a new git repository.

Here, I have created a folder called `firstProject`. If i want to initilize this folder as a git repo, I need to move into it and then run the `git init` command.

Now that I have moved into it, if I run `git status`, because I still have not initilized this as a git repo, an error will show up.

If we now run `git init`, it says `Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/NwCod/Documents/firstProject/.git/`

NOTE: `git init` is something we run one time per project so we're not constantly initializing if we're working on the same project day after day.

We use `git init` once per project. After we have run it once, we don't need to keep running it.

Now if we run `git status`, we something different. This means something has happened. Will cover what this means later.

---

Next up, we're going to talk about what actually happens when I run `git init` and where is the git folder or files or what information does it create?

 # The `.Git` Folder

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213458482-2cf49163-fe9d-45f0-a297-9ee692c56d59.png)

When we run `git init`, what happens? The docs say:

```
"git-init - Create an empty Git repository or reinitialize an existing one"
```

When we run `git init`, it creates a directory called `.git`. Hidden files begin with `.`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213458764-5fb110ea-2a1b-4d96-a903-2c65f9214920.png)

wHen we initilized the firstProject folder, a folder was created but it is hidden. To see it, we need to use `ls -a`:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213459109-6254484e-add2-44ef-a70a-abfa478d03a0.png)

Now we can see the `.git` folder. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213459292-fd8f8a9a-7aa0-4cdc-b70d-23627de5bcb0.png)

Then we can move into it using `cd` and use `ls` to see what is inside of it. This is what we just initilized.

---

Note: if we remove the `.git` folder using `rm -rf`, it will delete the entire git history for this project.

---

This `.git` folder is where everything is held together of that repository.
This folder will be located in every git repository you initialize.

# A Common Early Git Mistake

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213460366-3393f823-9550-44de-863b-ace575610297.png)

First, we need to understand that when we have a git repo, we initialize a git repo that's in one directory. In our example, it was the `firstProject` directory/folder. Git will watch everything that happens in this directory, including anything nested further down. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213463704-be924d7b-11bc-43ca-8ef2-a0f8367fa442.png)

Here, I am two levels down within the firstProjetc folder.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213463905-0946b605-c8b9-4f2f-9e79-b630bbd16f29.png)

Whislt even being two levels down, if i run `git status`, I still get feedback that says yes, you are in a git repo.

---

So, this is important to remember, any files and folders and changes I do in this directory for this one project (`firstProject`) are tracked by git if I initialized the repo like I did.

---

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213464523-7d8cbc07-0e87-4eba-af86-bf66b8ac086b.png)

But also REMEMBER: we do not want to be initializing another repo inside of an existing repo. If we do his, git will get confused. 

So, to avoid this,  make sure BEFORE you run `git init`, make sure you're not in a repository and that's why we showed you to use `git status` first. `git status` will tell us if we are already in a repo or not.

---

As a rule; make a folder for a project and then initialize git in that folder. You don't want to have a git repo on your desktop or your documents folder or on your entire machine that's tracking everything. You could, but most people prefer to have one repo per project, so always run, `git status`, make sure you're not in a repo before you initialize.

If you do happen to end up with nested repos, you can sort it out by deleting one of the `.git` folders.

# The Committing Workflow Overview - `git commit`

Commiting is the most important git feature. So, what is committing or what is a `git commit`?

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/213466457-5d9601ad-a077-4fa6-bb8d-a15ee25b63b7.png)

Let's says each step is like a checkpoint. So, as we make progress in our project, we add checkpoints or a snapshot of the project and it's new changes along with a little message like `add top nav bar` or `add first row of content` or `finish bottom row of content`, or `change to dark theme`, etc.

Well, each one of these checkpoints is actually in Git, what we would call a `commit`. A `git commit` is one of these checkpoints in a git repository.

Later on, we'll learn how to go back to earlier commits, how to undo commits, how to just take a peek at an earlier commit. But for now, we're just going to focus on making these checkpoints.

---

For example, How do we add a new feature to a website and then make a commit and then repeat, do some more stuff, make a commit, do some more stuff, make a commit etc.
