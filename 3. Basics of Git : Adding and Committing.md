This is what will be covered in this section. `Git Log` is also CRITICAL.

#  What Is A Git Repo?

Just because we have installed Git, this does not mean that Git is active or that we are using it. I have to manually tell Git when we want to use it and in which directories we have to create repositories.

So, if i'm working on a project, I need to tell Git to create a new repository. A repository is a Git workspace with its own history.

So every Git repo has its own history. They're not linked or connected in any way.

For example, I may have a bunch of folders which are different projects. Each one of these is a separate project. If I want to use Git, I have to go into each project folder and create a git repository.

And whatever happens in those folders, whatever get commands I run, whatever history I store with Git, they're completely separate and not connected.

This allows us to have different histories for each different project.
