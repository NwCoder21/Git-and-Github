# What Exactly Is Git?

Git is a version control system (VCS). Essentially, version control is software that helps track and manage changes to a set of files over time.

For example, a company like Facebook which has thousands of developers and files. They are working in parallel and making changes every day. How do you manage those and track those changes and combine them and undo changes? That is the role of a version control system like Git.

In general, most version control systems allow things like revisiting earlier versions of files, comparing changes made between different versions and different files, 
undoing changes, sharing changes with other people. This is what Git allows us to do and even more too.

Git is just one of many version control options that have come out over the years. 

They all have similar goals of helping developers or helping users track changes to projects over time. But they do have significant differences in how they operate, 
the syntax and how they achieve those goals.

However, Git is the most popular from Version Control Systems. Git has become even more popular since the above survey was taken.

This is how Git describes itself:

"Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency."

The main this to take away from this is that Git is a version control system at its core. It helps users manage changes to projects over time.

# Visualizing Git

So, what does Git do for us? It allows us to 

* Track changes across multiple files
* Compare versions of a project 
* Revert back to older versions
* Collaborate and share changes 
* Combine changes


The most important part is that Git allows us to collaborate and share changes. Git facilitates collaboration between a team of users, developers, and writers.
Whatever people are doing with Git, Git facilitates collaboration and sharing those changes between individual people.

Git lets us set up checkpoints. You can screw things up entirely, make a huge mess of a codebase or of a project, empty all the file out, delete the files, 
but if you're using Git and you made these checkpoints, you can just go back.


---

Another example is we are creating a design for a website.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212658584-83ebf24f-5608-4d85-940a-c706875cc35e.png)

These are the steps we have taken so far and then, if we need to go back to a previous version, using Git, we can ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212658722-e5de2369-7d38-4bf8-ab45-e84d481e61ae.png)

We can go backwards to a time before the dark theme was added. We can also branch off and do some work and create a new fork which is like an alternate timeline ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212660082-738b149b-ac93-48e8-b9ed-20dbac97185c.png)

But the great thing is, the main branch work, such as the grey out checkpoints (Add Dark Theme and Update Navbar), is still not lost.

We could then even switch back to what I had earlier. At this point, I can toggle between them

---

I can use Git to say go all the way back to when I first added the Navbar or go all the way up to when I updated the navbar. 
I can hop around and compare and I could present both to my boss. They both can exist.
Git helps us manage all of these different versions.

We can then also combine both timelines. So, now we have a website which has a footer and a third row of content and the dark mode colors.

Imagine working on a project where there are 10's and 100's of developers. This involves a lot of files and lots of different versions.
How do we coordinate all those changes between all of us and combine them?

# Who Uses Git?

First group would be engineers, developers, coders ranging from people who work on their own little tiny side projects or just hobby projects, entrepreneurs, up to massive tech giants like Facebook and Google. 

When you're developing applications, version control is very, very important to use.

Another group who uses Git or at least would benefit from being familiar with Git are tech adjacent roles. So, people who are not developers but work with developers or deal with developers.

# Git Vs. Github: What's The Difference?

Git and Github are closely related but they are not the same thing. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212673352-aafe7d9e-8905-4d23-a75c-0c70a497c812.png)

Git is a version control software and it runs on people's computers. It doesn't need Internet and you don't need to register for an account. 
It's just something that you download and can then use without internet like Microsoft Word or Excel. 

Github is a web service. And what it does is, it takes Git repositories, another way of saying git projects and it hosts them. It stores them in the cloud and makes it easier to collaborate on them with other people. So it's a website you do need an account for. 

Fir Github, you do need the Internet to use it and it takes the stuff you do locally on your laptop using Git and then it allows us to put that online and share it with other people. Or the other way around. Other people can put their stuff online and then we can get their code or their git projects on our machines.

First we will cover Git and then Github.

For example, if you are working on a project on your own on your local machine, If I wanted to share this with other people and collaborate with them, I could put it up on GitHub ...

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212674739-79f70d40-3c74-4b54-9263-14b7be1f616e.png)

This will allow other to see your project.

Then collaborators can take that work and get it on their machine. They can add on, modify it, they can do their own work to it and then share that back up to GitHub and then I can go and get it from GitHub and we can all work together. 

---

To summarise, Git and GitHub are not the same thing. GitHub requires some knowledge of Git. Github is a tool that is built for Git and for Git users. But you could live your entire life as a Git developer and never touch GitHub.
