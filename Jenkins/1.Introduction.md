# Jenkins Introduction 

A CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) Pipeline implementation is the backbone of the modern DevOps environment. It bridges the gap between development and operations by automating the build, test and deployment of applications.

Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practise incremental code changes are made more frequently and reliably. 

Automated build and test workflow steps triggered by Continuous Integration ensure that code changes being merged into the repository are reliable. That code / Application is then delivered quickly and seamlessly as part of the Continuous Deployment process.

CI is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day.

The code is written and pushed to a repository like Github or GitLab.


The code is verified by an automated build which allows teams or the project owner to detect any problems early.
