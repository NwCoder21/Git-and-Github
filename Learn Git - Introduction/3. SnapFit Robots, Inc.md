```

Click Save

---

Step 8: Add the file to the staging area. 

Solution:

```yaml
git add disclaimer.txt
git status
```

---

Step 9: Now make a commit. 

Solution:

```yaml
git commit -m "Add Warning"
```

---

Step 10: View your Git commit log again to identify your commit. 

Solution:

```yaml
git log
```

---

Step 11: Revise each file in whatever ways you’d like. Then add your changes to the staging area and make another commit. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212888776-4db1167b-f9c1-4a92-9925-ceeaa6c26347.png)

Added "Laugh" to the instructions.txt file

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212889069-1eae7c2d-7bc2-4a6e-a85b-43cdfd262d54.png)

Added "Special Offer!" to the warranty.txt file


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212889199-675e29d3-6d30-466d-8957-af68c11a3fc6.png)

Then, using `git add .` it added only the instructions.txt file and the warranty.txt file to the staging area even though we try to add all, including disclaimer.txt file, using `.`. The reason why it did not add disclaimer.txt file to the staging area is because system knows it has not been modified.

Then using `git commit -m "Third commit"`, I saved those changes. We can then use `git log` to view the log.
