# How to backtrack

# Backtracking Intro

When working on a Git project, sometimes we make changes that we want to get rid of. Git offers a few eraser-like features that allow us to undo mistakes during project creation. In this lesson, we’ll learn some of these features.

To start out, let’s review the basic Git workflow.

# Practise 

Step 1: You are in a Git project titled hamlet-prince-of-denmark. In the code editor, you’ll be working on scene-5.txt. Here, Hamlet encounters the ghost of his father. Add this text to the file:

```
Ghost: 
My hour is almost come,
When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
Must render up myself.
```

---

Step 2: From the terminal, add scene-5.txt to the staging area. 

Solution:

Step 3: Commit the changes to the repository with a good commit message. 

Solution:

# head commit

In Git, the commit you are currently on is known as the HEAD commit. In many cases, the most recently made commit is the HEAD commit. 

To see the `HEAD` commit, enter:

```
git show HEAD
```

The output of this command will display everything the [git log](https://www.codecademy.com/en/courses/learn-git/lessons/git-workflow/exercises/git-log) command displays for the `HEAD` commit, plus all the file changes that were committed. 

---

# Practise 

Step 1: Enter the command to show the `HEAD` commit. Notice the output. The ghost’s most recently added line is in green text.

Solution:

# git checkout

What if you decide to change the ghost’s line in the working directory, but then decide you wanted to discard that change?

You could rewrite the line how it was originally, but what if you forgot the exact wording? The command

```
git checkout HEAD filename
```

will restore the file in your working directory to look exactly as it did when you last made a commit.

Here, filename again is the actual name of the file. If the file is named **changes.txt**, the command would be

```
git checkout HEAD changes.txt
```

# Practise 

Step 1: Change the ghost’s words in some way. Here’s a fun suggestion:

```
Ghost:
My hour is almost come,
When I to sulphurous and tormenting balloons
Must render up myself. 
```

Solution:

---

Step 2: From the terminal, use `git diff` to see the difference between scene-5.txt as it appears in the working directory vs. how it appears in your last commit. You may need to press q on your keyboard to restore the terminal.

Solution:

---

Step 3: Use the new Git command to restore the file in your working directory to look as it did when you last made a commit. Close the scene-5.txt file and then re-open it to see that the changes you had previously made to the ghost’s line have been discarded.

Solution:

HINT: To revert changes that you have made to a file, use the following command:

```
git checkout HEAD filename
```

where filename is the file whose changes you wish to discard.
