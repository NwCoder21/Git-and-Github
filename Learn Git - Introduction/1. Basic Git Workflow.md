# Basic Git Workflow

# Hello Git

Git is a software that allows you to keep track of changes made to a project over time. Git works by recording the changes you make to a project, storing those changes, then allowing you to reference them as needed.

We’ll learn Git by using it to help us write a screenplay called _Harry Programmer and the Sorcerer’s Code_.

---

# Instructions  

We’ll get started by taking a look at the screenplay project.

In scene-1.txt, add this text: 

```yaml
Harry Programmer and the Sorcerer’s Code: Scene 1
```

Then press enter to create a new empty line. Once you’ve created the new line, click Run. 

Solution:

---

# git init

Now that we have started working on the screenplay, let’s turn the sorcerers-code directory into a Git project. We do this with:

```yaml
git init
```

The word init means initialize. The command sets up all the tools Git needs to begin tracking changes made to the project.

# Instructions 

In the terminal, initialize a new Git project.

Notice the output:

`Initalized empty Git repository in /home/ccuser/workspace/sorcerers-code/.git/`

The Git project was created.

# Git Workflow

Nice! We have a Git project. A Git project can be thought of as having three parts:

1. A Working Directory: where you’ll be doing all the work: creating, editing, deleting and organizing files
2. A Staging Area: where you’ll list changes you make to the working directory
3. A Repository: where Git permanently stores those changes as different versions of the project

The Git workflow consists of editing files in the working directory, adding files to the staging area, and saving changes to a Git repository. In Git, we save changes with a `commit`, which we will learn more about in this lesson.

---

# Instructions

Take a look at the diagram. Before we move on, it will help to be familiar with the three parts of the Git workflow. 

---

# git status

As you write the screenplay, you will be changing the contents of the working directory. You can check the status of those changes with:

```yaml
git status 
```

---

# Instructions

From the terminal, check the status of the **sorcerers-code** project.

In the output, notice the file in red under `untracked files`. Untracked means that Git sees the file but has not started tracking changes yet.

Solution:

---

# git add

In order for Git to start tracking **scene-1.txt**, the file needs to be added to the staging area.

We can add a file to the staging area with:

```yaml
git add filename
```

The word filename here refers to the name of the file you are editing, such as **scene-1.txt**.

---

# Instructions 

Step 1: Add scene-1.txt to the staging area in Git. Recall that you will need to identify the file by its name. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/107522496/212719276-fc910147-94d5-4ec8-98e4-3d618f4f6201.png)

---

Step 2: Check the status of the project in Git.

In the output, notice that Git indicates the changes to be committed with “new file: scene-1.txt” in green text. Here Git tells us the file was added to the staging area.

Solution:

---

# git diff

Now you know how to add a file to the staging area. 

Imagine that we type another line in scene-1.txt. Since the file is tracked, we can check the differences between the working directory and the staging area with: 

```yaml
git diff filename
```

Here, filename is the actual name of the file. If the name of my file was **changes.txt** the command would be

```yaml
git diff changes.txt
```

---

# Instructions

Step 1: In the code editor, add this text to scene-1.txt:

Dumblediff: I should've known you would be here, Professor McGonagit.

Click Run.

Solution:

---

Step 2: From the terminal, use the new command to check the difference between the working directory and the staging area.

Notice the output:

    * “Harry Programmer and the Sorcerer’s Code: Scene 1” is in the staging area, as indicated in white.
    * Changes to the file are marked with a + and are indicated in green.

---

Step 3: 

Add the changes to the staging area in Git. Recall that you will need to identify the file by its name.

HINT: 

We can add a file to the staging area with:

```yaml
git add filename
```

---

# git commit

A **commit** is the last step in our Git workflow. A commit permanently stores changes from the staging area inside the repository.

`git commit` is the command we’ll do next. However, one more bit of code is needed for a commit: the option `-m` followed by a message. Here’s an example:

```yaml
git commit -m "Complete first line of dialogue"
```
Standard Conventions for Commit Messages:

* Must be in quotation marks
* Written in the present tense
* Should be brief (50 characters or less) when using `-m`

---

# Instructions 

Make your first commit! From the terminal, type the command along with a commit message. The message should describe the point of the commit.

If you’re having trouble thinking of a good commit message, reflect on how the project has changed since it began.

---

# git log

Often with Git, you’ll need to refer back to an earlier version of a project. Commits are stored chronologically in the repository and can be viewed with: 

```yaml
git log
```
